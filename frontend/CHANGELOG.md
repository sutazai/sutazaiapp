## [2025-08-19] - Initial Frontend Investigation

### Status: ❌ CONFLICTING DOCUMENTATION (RESOLVED 2025-08-27)

#### Previous Assessment - INCORRECT
- ❌ **Container**: NOT RUNNING - sutazai-frontend container not found
- ❌ **Dependencies**: NOT INSTALLED - Streamlit import fails
- ❌ **Accessibility**: INACCESSIBLE - net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

#### Resolution (2025-08-27)
- ✅ **RESOLUTION CONFIRMED**: Above issues were documentation errors
- ✅ **ACTUAL STATE**: Frontend was working but not properly documented
- ✅ **LESSON LEARNED**: Always verify system state before documenting issues

### Added
- CHANGELOG.md file created for Rule 18 compliance
- Comprehensive test investigation completed
- Frontend architecture analysis documented

### Security
- Docker configuration follows Rule 11 (non-root user, pinned versions)
- Requirements include security-patched dependencies
