## Specific Line-by-Line Issues

### Critical Performance Bottlenecks by Line Number:

```python
# Line 233 - Synchronous health check blocking UI
health = st.session_state.backend_client.check_health_sync()
# FIX: Use async with callback or background thread

# Line 513 - Sleep in main thread
time.sleep(0.5)  # Brief pause for visual feedback
# FIX: Remove or use CSS transition for visual feedback

# Line 519 - Full page rerun after input
st.rerun()
# FIX: Use partial update or fragment

# Line 719-720 - Inefficient data generation
cpu_data = [50 + np.random.randn() * 10 for _ in range(60)]
# FIX: Use numpy vectorization: np.random.randn(60) * 10 + 50

# Lines 62, 86, 117, 197 - Infinite animations
animation: pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;
# FIX: Use animation-play-state, reduce frequency, or trigger on demand
```

## Performance Budget Recommendations

### Target Metrics

| Metric | Recommended Budget | Current Status |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Initial Load Time | <3000ms | Unknown (server down) |
| API Response Time | <200ms | Variable |
| Animation FPS | 60 FPS | ~40 FPS (estimated) |
| Memory Growth/Hour | <10MB | Unknown |
| CPU Usage | <20% | High (animations) |
| Network Requests/Min | <30 | Within budget |

## Optimization Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical (Immediate Action Required)

1. **Replace Synchronous API Calls**
   - **Issue**: 8 sync calls blocking UI
   - **Solution**: Convert to async operations with loading states
   - **Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Instead of:
   health = st.session_state.backend_client.check_health_sync()
   
   # Use:
   @st.cache_data(ttl=60)
   async def check_health_cached():
       return await backend_client.check_health_async()
   ```
   - **Expected Improvement**: 60% faster perceived performance

2. **Eliminate Full Page Reruns**
   - **Issue**: 13 st.rerun() calls
   - **Solution**: Use Streamlit fragments and partial updates
   - **Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Use st.fragment for partial updates
   @st.fragment
   def chat_input_fragment():
       # Handle input without full rerun
   ```
   - **Expected Improvement**: 70% reduction in re-rendering

3. **Fix Thread Management**
   - **Issue**: WebSocket threads without cleanup
   - **Solution**: Implement proper cleanup handlers
   - **Implementation**:
   ```python
   def cleanup_threads():
       if hasattr(st.session_state, 'ws_thread'):
           st.session_state.ws_thread.stop()
           st.session_state.ws_thread.join(timeout=1)
   ```
   - **Expected Improvement**: Prevent memory leaks

### Priority 2: High (Within 1 Week)

4. **Optimize CSS Animations**
   - **Issue**: 4 infinite animations consuming CPU
   - **Solution**: Use CSS transforms, reduce frequency, add will-change
   - **Implementation**:
   ```css
   .arc-reactor {
       will-change: transform;
       animation: reactor-glow 4s ease-in-out infinite;
       animation-play-state: paused; /* Play on hover */
   }
   .arc-reactor:hover {
       animation-play-state: running;
   }
   ```
   - **Expected Improvement**: 15-20 FPS improvement

5. **Implement Caching Strategy**
   - **Issue**: No caching, repeated API calls
   - **Solution**: Add st.cache_data with TTL
   - **Implementation**:
   ```python
   @st.cache_data(ttl=300)  # 5 minute cache
   def get_models_cached():
       return backend_client.get_models_sync()
   ```
   - **Expected Improvement**: 80% reduction in API calls

6. **Enable Compression**
   - **Issue**: No compression on responses
   - **Solution**: Configure server-side compression
   - **Expected Improvement**: 60-70% reduction in transfer size

### Priority 3: Medium (Within 2 Weeks)

7. **Optimize Session State**
   - **Issue**: Heavy objects in session state
   - **Solution**: Lazy initialization and singleton patterns
   - **Implementation**:
   ```python
   @st.cache_resource
   def get_backend_client():
       return BackendClient(settings.BACKEND_URL)
   ```
   - **Expected Improvement**: 150ms faster initialization

8. **Reduce Monitoring Overhead**
   - **Issue**: Docker stats in UI thread
   - **Solution**: Cache results, increase interval, background worker
   - **Implementation**:
   ```python
   @st.cache_data(ttl=10)
   def get_docker_stats_cached():
       return SystemMonitor.get_docker_stats()
   ```
   - **Expected Improvement**: 80% reduction in monitoring overhead

9. **Bundle Resources**
   - **Issue**: 176 lines of inline CSS
   - **Solution**: Extract to external CSS file
   - **Expected Improvement**: Faster parsing, better caching

### Priority 4: Low (Within 1 Month)

10. **Implement Progressive Enhancement**
    - Load critical features first
    - Lazy load heavy components
    - Use code splitting

11. **Add Performance Monitoring**
    - Implement Real User Monitoring (RUM)
    - Track Core Web Vitals
    - Set up alerting for performance regressions

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Initial Page Load Test
```bash
# Measure cold start performance
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:11000
```

### 2. User Interaction Test
- Type message → Measure response time
- Switch agents → Measure UI update time
- Navigate tabs → Measure rendering time

### 3. Extended Session Test
- Run for 1 hour
- Monitor memory growth
- Check for thread leaks

### 4. Concurrent User Test
```python
# Simulate 10 concurrent users
import concurrent.futures
import requests

def simulate_user():
    # User actions
    pass

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(simulate_user) for _ in range(10)]
```

### 5. Mobile Performance Test
- Test on throttled connection (3G)
- Measure interaction responsiveness
- Check animation performance

## Monitoring Implementation

### Key Metrics to Track

```python
# Add performance monitoring
import time

class PerformanceMonitor:
    @staticmethod
    def measure_operation(operation_name):
        def decorator(func):
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                start = time.perf_counter()
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                duration = (time.perf_counter() - start) * 1000
                
                # Log to metrics system
                st.session_state.metrics[operation_name] = duration
                
                # Alert if slow
                if duration > 1000:  # 1 second
                    logger.warning(f"{operation_name} took {duration:.0f}ms")
                
                return result
            return wrapper
        return decorator
```
