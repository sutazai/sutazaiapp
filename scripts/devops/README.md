# DevOps Scripts

Purpose: Centralize DevOps-related automation (CI helpers, environments, infra checks) per repository rules.

- Scope: provisioning helpers, CI utilities, environment diagnostics, infra sanity checks.
- Non-goals: deployment orchestration (see `scripts/deployment/`), monitoring (see `scripts/monitoring/`).

This directory exists to satisfy structure validation and keep scripts categorized and discoverable.
