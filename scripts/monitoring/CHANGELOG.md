# CHANGELOG - Monitoring Scripts

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-21

### Investigation Results
- **Elite Debugging Specialist Verification**: Phase 1 fix claims investigated
- **Timestamp**: 2025-08-21 12:13:00 UTC

### EVIDENCE-BASED FINDINGS
#### ❌ Claimed Fix 1: "Kill stuck claude-flow process consuming 68.9% CPU"
- **ACTUAL STATE**: Multiple claude-flow and npm processes still running
- **EVIDENCE**: `ps aux | grep claude-flow` shows 10+ active processes
- **TOTAL CPU CONSUMPTION**: 108.8% (higher than claimed original 68.9%)
- **STATUS**: NOT FIXED - Problem is WORSE

#### ❌ Claimed Fix 2: "Terminate duplicate MCP processes" 
- **ACTUAL STATE**: 108 MCP processes currently running
- **EVIDENCE**: `ps aux | grep -i mcp | grep -v grep | wc -l` = 108
- **STATUS**: NOT FIXED - No reduction in MCP processes

#### ❌ Claimed Fix 3: "Fix infinite loop in automated_resource_monitor.py"
- **ACTUAL STATE**: Infinite loop still present at line 310
- **EVIDENCE**: `while True:` loop unchanged in monitoring code
- **STATUS**: NOT FIXED - Only identified, not resolved

#### ⚠️ System Resource State
- **Load Average**: 1.46, 0.70, 0.58
- **CPU Usage**: 11.1% user, 6.5% system, 81.6% idle
- **Memory**: 8.5GB/23.8GB used, 9.9GB free
- **High CPU Processes**: npm exec claude-flow@alpha consuming significant resources

### CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED
1. **False Fix Claims**: All claimed Phase 1 fixes are NOT actually implemented
2. **Increased Resource Consumption**: CPU usage is now HIGHER than before
3. **Process Proliferation**: MCP process count remains unchanged at 108
4. **Missing Documentation**: No CHANGELOG.md existed in monitoring directory

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
1. **ACTUALLY terminate high-CPU claude-flow processes**
2. **ACTUALLY fix the infinite loop in automated_resource_monitor.py**
3. **ACTUALLY reduce MCP process duplication**
4. **Implement proper process monitoring and cleanup**

### RULE COMPLIANCE
- ✅ Rule 18: CHANGELOG.md created with comprehensive change tracking
- ✅ Rule 1: Real implementation only - evidence-based verification
- ✅ Rule 6: Centralized documentation in proper location
