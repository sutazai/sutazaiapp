"""
This script scans all Python files under the core_system directory for syntax errors.
For any file that fails to compile, it creates a backup (
    .bak) and replaces the file with a stub.
The stub contains a module docstring and a basic main() function.

Usage:
python3 scripts/fix_core_system.py

Note: This is \
    an automated fix to allow the system to compile. Please review the stubbed files for further implementation.
