# Deprecated: Service Mesh Scripts

These scripts (Kong/Consul/RabbitMQ orchestration) are deprecated and retained only for historical reference.

- The `docker-compose.service-mesh.yml` stack has been removed.
- Do not use these scripts in production or development.
- If the mesh is reintroduced, these should be audited, tested, and modernized before use.

See: `docs/decisions/2025-08-07-remove-service-mesh.md` for rationale.
