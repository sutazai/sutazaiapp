# Functionality Preservation Validator

A comprehensive agent that enforces **Rule 2: Do Not Break Existing Functionality** by analyzing code changes and preventing regressions before they reach production.

## Overview

The Functionality Preservation Validator is a production-ready tool that:

- **Tracks all file modifications** and analyzes their impact on existing functionality
- **Detects breaking changes** in functions, classes, APIs, and interfaces
- **Runs automated tests** before and after changes to catch regressions
- **Creates dependency graphs** to understand usage patterns
- **Integrates with git hooks** to prevent breaking commits
- **Provides detailed reports** with actionable suggestions

## Features

### üîç AST Analysis
- Parses Python code to extract function signatures, class definitions, and API endpoints
- Compares before/after states to identify breaking changes
- Tracks parameter changes, return types, and method removals

### üåê API Monitoring
- Detects Flask and FastAPI endpoint changes
- Validates HTTP method modifications
- Checks parameter and response schema changes

### üß™ Test Integration
- Runs test suites on both previous and current code states
- Compares test results to identify new failures
- Provides detailed test regression analysis

### üìä Dependency Analysis
- Maps import relationships between modules
- Identifies files that depend on modified code
- Warns about potential cascade effects

### üö´ Git Integration
- Installs pre-commit hooks automatically
- Blocks commits with breaking changes
- Provides rollback suggestions

## Installation

1. **Place the validator in your project**:
   ```bash
   # The script should be at: scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py
   chmod +x scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py
   ```

2. **Install git hooks** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py setup-hooks
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install ast-tools pytest networkx
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Validation

Validate all changes against the main branch:
```bash
python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py validate
```

Validate against a specific branch:
```bash
python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py validate --base-branch develop
```

### Output Formats

**Summary format** (for CI/CD):
```bash
python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py validate --format summary
```

**Detailed format** (for developers):
```bash
python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py validate --format detailed
```

**JSON format** (for tools integration):
```bash
python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py validate --format json
```

### Analyze Specific Files

Analyze specific files without running full validation:
```bash
python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py analyze --files src/api.py src/models.py
```

### Generate Reports

Create a comprehensive validation report:
```bash
python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py report --output validation-report.json
```

### Test-Only Validation

Run only test comparison:
```bash
python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py test
```

## Configuration

The validator can be configured using `functionality-preservation-config.yaml`:

```yaml
general:
  base_branch: "main"
  log_level: "INFO"

rules:
  functions:
    check_signature_changes: true
    check_parameter_removal: true
    allow_parameter_addition: true
  
  classes:
    check_method_removal: true
    check_inheritance_changes: true
  
  api:
    check_endpoint_removal: true
    check_parameter_changes: true

severity:
  function_removed: "error"
  method_removed: "error"
  api_endpoint_removed: "error"
  function_signature_changed: "error"
```

## Validation Categories

### ‚ùå Breaking Changes (Block Commit)
- **Function Removed**: A function that was previously available is no longer present
- **Class Removed**: A class definition has been deleted
- **Method Removed**: A method has been removed from a class
- **API Endpoint Removed**: An HTTP endpoint is no longer available
- **Function Signature Changed**: Function parameters or return types modified
- **Test Regression**: Previously passing tests now fail

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings (Review Required)
- **Function Defaults Changed**: Default parameter values modified
- **Class Inheritance Changed**: Base classes modified
- **Import Removed**: Module imports removed
- **API Parameters Changed**: Endpoint parameters modified
- **Configuration Changed**: Config files modified

### ‚úÖ Safe Changes (Informational)
- **Function Added**: New functions added
- **Method Added**: New methods added to classes
- **Test Improvement**: Previously failing tests now pass

## Integration Examples

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/validation.yml
name: Functionality Validation
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Need full history for comparison
      
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Run functionality validation
        run: |
          python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py validate --format summary
          if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "Breaking changes detected. Please review."
            exit 1
          fi
```

### Pre-commit Hook

The validator automatically creates a pre-commit hook when you run:
```bash
python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py setup-hooks
```

This hook will:
1. Run validation on all staged changes
2. Block commits if breaking changes are detected
3. Show a summary of issues found
4. Provide commands for detailed analysis

### IDE Integration

For VS Code, add to your tasks.json:
```json
{
  "label": "Validate Functionality",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "python",
  "args": [
    "scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py",
    "validate",
    "--format",
    "detailed"
  ],
  "group": "test",
  "presentation": {
    "echo": true,
    "reveal": "always",
    "focus": false,
    "panel": "shared"
  }
}
```

## Report Structure

The validator generates comprehensive reports in JSON format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-03T10:30:00Z",
  "summary": {
    "total_checks": 25,
    "passed": 20,
    "warnings": 3,
    "failures": 2,
    "breaking_changes": 1
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "status": "fail",
      "category": "function_removed",
      "message": "Function 'calculate_tax' was removed",
      "file_path": "src/billing.py",
      "line_number": 45,
      "breaking_change": true,
      "suggestion": "Consider deprecating instead of removing, or ensure no code depends on this function"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "‚ùå CRITICAL: Breaking changes detected. Review all failures before committing.",
    "Consider using feature flags or deprecation warnings for gradual migration."
  ]
}
```

## Testing the Validator

Run the included test suite to verify the validator works correctly:

```bash
python scripts/agents/test-functionality-validator.py
```

This will:
1. Create a temporary git repository
2. Test various scenarios (breaking changes, safe changes, etc.)
3. Verify the validator correctly identifies issues
4. Clean up test files

## Best Practices

### 1. Run Early and Often
- Validate changes frequently during development
- Don't wait until commit time to discover breaking changes

### 2. Use Feature Flags
- For major changes, use feature flags to gradually roll out functionality
- This allows for safer deployments and easier rollbacks

### 3. Deprecation Strategy
- Instead of removing functions immediately, mark them as deprecated
- Provide migration paths for consumers

### 4. Test Coverage
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage before relying on test regression detection
- Write tests for both positive and negative scenarios

### 5. Documentation
- Update API documentation when making changes
- Include migration guides for breaking changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Git diff failed"**
- Ensure you're in a git repository
- Check that the base branch exists
- Verify git is installed and accessible

**"Could not parse file"**
- Check for syntax errors in Python files
- Ensure file encoding is UTF-8
- Verify file permissions

**"Tests not found"**
- Ensure pytest is installed
- Check test directory configuration
- Verify test files follow naming conventions

**"Validation timeout"**
- Large codebases may take time to analyze
- Consider using `--files` to analyze specific files
- Increase timeout in configuration

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.
python -c "import logging; logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)"
python scripts/agents/functionality-preservation-validator.py validate
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Rules

Extend the validator by modifying the configuration:

```yaml
