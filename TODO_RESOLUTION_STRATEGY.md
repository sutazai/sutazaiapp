# TODO/FIXME Resolution Strategy and Tracking System

**Created**: 2025-08-15 23:00:00 UTC
**Objective**: Resolve 10,867 TODO/FIXME/HACK comments and achieve Rule 1 compliance

## Current State Analysis

### Statistics
- **Total TODO/FIXME/HACK Comments**: 10,867
- **Affected Files**: ~1,435 Python files + other file types
- **Critical Areas**: Backend, Agents, Services, Scripts

### Severity Classification

#### BLOCKING (P0) - Immediate Resolution Required
- Security vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization gaps
- Data integrity issues
- Critical error handling missing
- **Estimated Count**: ~2,000

#### HIGH (P1) - Next Sprint Priority
- Performance bottlenecks
- API contract violations
- Core feature incompleteness
- **Estimated Count**: ~3,000

#### MEDIUM (P2) - Technical Debt
- Code optimization needs
- Refactoring opportunities
- Documentation gaps
- **Estimated Count**: ~2,500

#### LOW (P3) - Nice to Have
- UI/UX improvements
- Minor optimizations
- Future enhancements
- **Estimated Count**: ~3,367

## Resolution Process

### Phase 1: Automated Analysis and Categorization
1. Scan all files for TODO/FIXME/HACK patterns
2. Extract context and classify by severity
3. Generate tracking issues for each item
4. Create resolution priority matrix

### Phase 2: BLOCKING Resolution (Immediate)
1. Security implementations
2. Authentication systems
3. Error handling
4. Data validation

### Phase 3: HIGH Priority Resolution
1. Performance optimizations
2. API completions
3. Core feature implementations

### Phase 4: Documentation and Tracking
1. Update CHANGELOG.md with resolutions
2. Document patterns for prevention
3. Implement pre-commit hooks

## Tracking System

### Issue Format
```
ID: TODO-XXXX
File: /path/to/file.py:line
Severity: BLOCKING|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW
Category: Security|Performance|Feature|Documentation
Original: "TODO: implement authentication"
Resolution: [Description of fix]
Status: Open|In Progress|Resolved
Date Created: YYYY-MM-DD
Date Resolved: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## Prevention Measures

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Block commits with BLOCKING TODOs
- Warn on HIGH priority TODOs
- Require issue tracking for new TODOs

### Code Review Standards
- No PR approval with unresolved BLOCKING items
- TODO comments must include:
  - Issue tracking number
  - Expected resolution date
  - Owner assignment

### Monitoring
- Weekly TODO count tracking
- Severity distribution monitoring
- Age analysis for old TODOs

## Success Metrics

### Target Outcomes
- 100% BLOCKING TODOs resolved
- 80% HIGH priority resolved
- 50% MEDIUM priority resolved
- All remaining TODOs tracked in issue system

### Timeline
- Week 1: Analysis and BLOCKING resolution
- Week 2: HIGH priority resolution
- Week 3: MEDIUM priority and tracking system
- Week 4: Documentation and prevention measures

## Next Steps

1. Run comprehensive TODO scanner
2. Generate categorized report
3. Create issue tracking entries
4. Begin BLOCKING resolutions
5. Implement CHANGELOG.md files
