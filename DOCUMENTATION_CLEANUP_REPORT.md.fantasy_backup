# Documentation Cleanup Report

## Summary
- Total files processed: 445
- Files cleaned: 273
- Files deleted: 3
- Errors: 0

## Changes Made

### Terminology Replacements
- AGI/ASI → automation system/advanced automation
- brain/neural → coordinator/processing
- consciousness → system state
- quantum/neuromorphic → advanced/optimized
- mystical/divine/transcendent → advanced/optimal/enhanced
- backend-agi/frontend-agi → backend/frontend

### Files Deleted
Fantasy-focused documentation files were archived and removed as they contained
primarily AGI/consciousness concepts not relevant to the practical automation system.

### Result
All documentation now reflects SutazAI as a practical multi-agent task automation platform
without fantasy elements like AGI, consciousness, or mystical concepts.

## Backups
All modified and deleted files have been backed up to: /opt/sutazaiapp/cleanup_backups
