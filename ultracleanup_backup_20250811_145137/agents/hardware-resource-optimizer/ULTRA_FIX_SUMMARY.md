## üéØ CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED

### 1. ‚úÖ EVENT LOOP CONFLICT RESOLVED (Lines 990-995)
**Problem:** Event loop conflict when calling async methods from sync context  
**ULTRA-FIX:** 
- Implemented smart event loop detection
- Added thread-based execution for sync calls
- Created `_run_memory_optimization_sync()` method
- Fixed asyncio usage with proper exception handling

```python
def _optimize_memory(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """ULTRA-FIX: Fixed event loop conflict - use existing loop if available"""
    try:
        # Check if we're already in an event loop
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        # If we're in a loop, create a task and run it synchronously
        import concurrent.futures
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            future = executor.submit(self._run_memory_optimization_sync)
            return future.result(timeout=30)
    except RuntimeError:
        # No event loop running, create a new one
        loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
        asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
        try:
            return loop.run_until_complete(self._optimize_memory_async())
        finally:
            loop.close()
```

### 2. ‚úÖ PORT CONFIGURATION FIXED
**Problem:** Port configuration chaos between Docker and application  
**ULTRA-FIX:**
- Verified docker-compose.yml uses correct port mapping: `11110:8080`
- Application correctly reads PORT environment variable (8080)
- Health checks use correct internal port (8080)
- External access via port 11110 works correctly

### 3. ‚úÖ DOCKER CLIENT INITIALIZATION HARDENED
**Problem:** Thread-unsafe Docker client initialization  
**ULTRA-FIX:**
- Added thread-safe Docker client with mutex locks
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added proper timeout handling (10s)
- Thread-safe access to Docker operations

```python
def _init_docker_client_safe(self):
    """ULTRA-FIX: Thread-safe Docker client initialization with retry logic"""
    with self.docker_client_lock:
        max_retries = 3
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            try:
                client = docker.from_env(timeout=10)
                client.ping()
                self.docker_client = client
                self.logger.info("Docker client initialized successfully")
                return
            except Exception as e:
                # Handle retry logic...
```

### 4. ‚úÖ THREAD SAFETY VIOLATIONS ELIMINATED
**Problem:** Race conditions in hash cache and Docker operations  
**ULTRA-FIX:**
- Added `threading.Lock` for hash cache operations
- Thread-safe Docker client access with mutex
- Protected all shared resources with proper locking
- Concurrent file hash computation safely handled

```python
# Thread-safe hash cache access
with self.hash_cache_lock:
    if validated_path in self.hash_cache:
        return self.hash_cache[validated_path]
```

### 5. ‚úÖ PATH TRAVERSAL SECURITY COMPLETED
**Problem:** Incomplete path traversal protection  
**ULTRA-FIX:**
- Enhanced `validate_safe_path()` function with complete validation
- Added security checks to ALL endpoints that accept paths
- Implemented file system access validation (exists + readable)
- Comprehensive protection against directory traversal attacks

```python
@self.app.get("/analyze/storage")
async def analyze_storage(path: str = Query("/", description="Path to analyze")):
    """Analyze storage usage with detailed breakdown"""
    try:
        safe_path = validate_safe_path(path, "/")
        if not os.path.exists(safe_path):
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=f"Path not found: {path}")
        if not os.access(safe_path, os.R_OK):
            raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail=f"Access denied: {path}")
    except ValueError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail=str(e))
    # ... rest of endpoint
```
