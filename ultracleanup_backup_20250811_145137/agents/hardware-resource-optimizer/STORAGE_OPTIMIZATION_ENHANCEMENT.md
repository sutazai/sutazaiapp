# Hardware Resource Optimizer - Storage Optimization Enhancement

## Overview
The hardware-resource-optimizer agent has been enhanced with comprehensive storage optimization features. This document outlines all the new capabilities added to provide intelligent, safe, and aggressive storage optimization strategies.

## New Storage Analysis Endpoints

**Response**: Comprehensive breakdown including:
- Total file count and size
- File extension statistics
- Size distribution buckets
- Age distribution analysis

### 2. GET /analyze/storage/duplicates
**Purpose**: Find duplicate files across the system using SHA256 hash comparison
**Parameters**:
- `path` (query): Path to scan for duplicates (default: "/")

**Response**: 
- Duplicate groups with file details
- Space wasted by duplicates
- Detailed duplicate file information

### 3. GET /analyze/storage/large-files
**Purpose**: Identify unusually large files
**Parameters**:
- `path` (query): Path to scan (default: "/")
- `min_size_mb` (query): Minimum file size in MB (default: 100)

**Response**:
- List of large files with size and age
- Total size of large files
- File details for optimization decisions

### 4. GET /analyze/storage/report
**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive storage analysis report
**Response**:
- Disk usage statistics
- Analysis of key system directories
- Duplicate and large file summaries
- Optimization recommendations

## New Storage Optimization Endpoints

### 1. POST /optimize/storage
**Purpose**: Main storage optimization with smart cleanup
**Parameters**:
- `dry_run` (query): Perform dry run without actual deletion (default: false)

**Features**:
- Cleans temporary files older than 3 days
- Removes old cache files (7+ days)
- Application-specific cache cleanup (pip, npm, apt)
- Intelligent log rotation
- Safe deletion with backup to temp location

### 2. POST /optimize/storage/duplicates
**Purpose**: Remove duplicate files with safety checks
**Parameters**:
- `path` (query): Path to deduplicate (default: "/")
- `dry_run` (query): Perform dry run (default: false)

**Features**:
- Keeps newest version of duplicate files
- Safe deletion with backup
- Detailed reporting of space saved

### 3. POST /optimize/storage/cache
**Purpose**: Clear various system and application caches
**Features**:
- System cache clearing (sync)
- Package manager cache cleanup (apt, yum)
- Browser cache removal (Chrome, Firefox)
- Thumbnail cache cleanup

### 4. POST /optimize/storage/compress
**Purpose**: Compress old/archived files
**Parameters**:
- `path` (query): Path to compress files (default: "/var/log")
- `days_old` (query): Compress files older than N days (default: 30)

**Features**:
- GZIP compression for text files (.log, .txt, .csv, .sql, .json, .xml)
- Verification of compression effectiveness
- Only compresses if space savings achieved

### 5. POST /optimize/storage/logs
**Purpose**: Intelligent log rotation and cleanup
**Features**:
- Deletes logs older than 90 days
- Compresses logs older than 7 days
- SQLite database VACUUM operations
- Minimum compression ratio requirements

## Safety Features

### Protected Paths
The following paths are never modified:
- `/etc`, `/boot`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib`
- `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`
- User data directories: `/home/*/Documents`, `/home/*/Desktop`, `/home/*/Pictures`

### Safe Deletion Process
1. Files are moved to `/tmp/hardware_optimizer_safety` before deletion
2. All operations are logged with full audit trail
3. Dry-run mode available for all destructive operations
4. Verification checks before permanent deletion

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient directory scanning using `os.scandir`
- File hash caching to avoid recomputation
- Batch processing to prevent memory issues
- Progress reporting for long operations
- Depth-limited scanning to prevent infinite recursion

## Integration with Existing Features

### Enhanced "Optimize All" Endpoint
The existing `/optimize/all` endpoint now includes comprehensive storage optimization:
- Memory optimization
- CPU optimization  
- Disk optimization (enhanced)
- Docker optimization
- **NEW**: Comprehensive storage optimization

### Task Processing Support
All new storage operations are supported through the task processing interface:
- `analyze_storage`
- `analyze_duplicates` 
- `analyze_large_files`
- `storage_report`
- `optimize_storage`
- `optimize_duplicates`
- `optimize_cache`
- `optimize_compress`
- `optimize_logs`

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Hash Computation
- Uses SHA256 for reliable duplicate detection
- Implements caching to avoid recomputation
- Chunked reading for memory efficiency

### Compression Algorithm
- GZIP compression for text-based files
- Minimum 20% space savings requirement
- Preserves original file permissions and metadata

### Database Optimization
- SQLite VACUUM operations for database files
- Automatic detection of `.db` and `.sqlite` files
- Safe handling of database connections

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling for all operations
- Graceful degradation when permissions are insufficient
- Detailed error reporting with actionable information

## Usage Examples
