```

## Code Standards

### Python Development
- **Python 3.12.8 REQUIRED** - Standardized across all services (August 10, 2025)
- Use Poetry for dependency management (pyproject.toml)
- Black for formatting, isort for imports
- Type hints required for new code
- Async/await patterns for I/O operations
- UUID primary keys for all database tables
- All Docker base images use python:3.12.8-slim-bookworm

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- pytest for all testing
- Use fixtures for database/service mocking
- Integration tests require Docker services

### Git Workflow
- Never commit to main directly
- Feature branches from main
- PR requires passing tests and linting
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all changes

## Common Tasks

### Fix Model Mismatch
```bash
# Option 1: Load gpt-oss model
docker exec sutazai-ollama ollama pull gpt-oss

# Option 2: Update backend to use tinyllama
# Edit backend config to use "tinyllama" instead of "gpt-oss"
```

### Database Schema Status
```bash
# PostgreSQL schema already initialized with 10 tables
# Tables use UUID primary keys and proper indexing
# Automated backup strategy active for all databases
docker exec -it sutazai-postgres psql -U sutazai -c '\dt'  # View tables
```

### Convert Agent Stub to Real Implementation
1. Navigate to `/agents/[agent-name]/app.py`
2. Replace Flask with FastAPI
3. Implement actual logic instead of returning hardcoded JSON
4. Integrate with Ollama for AI capabilities
5. Add proper error handling and logging

## Performance Considerations

- Redis caching enabled but not fully utilized
- Connection pooling needed for PostgreSQL
- Agent services consume ~100MB RAM each (stubs)
- Ollama with TinyLlama: 5-8 second response time (optimized from 75s)
- Redis hit rate: 86% (improved from 5.3%)
- Total system uses ~15GB RAM (can be optimized to ~6GB)

## üìã COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES

**Added:** December 19, 2024  
**Purpose:** Establish firm engineering standards and discipline for this codebase

These rules are MANDATORY for all contributors. They ensure codebase hygiene, prevent regression, and maintain professional standards.

### üîß Codebase Hygiene
A clean, consistent, and organized codebase is non-negotiable. It reflects engineering discipline and enables scalability, team velocity, and fault tolerance.

Every contributor is accountable for maintaining and improving hygiene‚Äînot just avoiding harm.

üßº **Enforce Consistency Relentlessly**
‚úÖ Follow the existing structure, naming patterns, and conventions. Never introduce your own style or shortcuts.
‚úÖ Centralize logic ‚Äî do not duplicate code across files, modules, or services.
üö´ Avoid multiple versions of:
- APIs doing the same task (REST + GraphQL duplicating effort, for example)
- UI components or CSS/SCSS modules with near-identical logic or styling
- Scripts that solve the same problem in slightly different ways
- Requirements files scattered across environments with conflicting dependencies
- Documentation split across folders with different levels of accuracy

üìÇ **Project Structure Discipline**
üìå Never dump files or code in random or top-level folders.
üìå Place everything intentionally, following modular boundaries:
- `components/` for reusable UI parts
- `services/` or `api/` for network interactions
- `utils/` for pure logic or helpers
- `hooks/` for reusable frontend logic
- `schemas/` or `types/` for data validation

If the ideal location doesn't exist, propose a clear structure and open a small RFC (Request for Comments) before proceeding.

üóëÔ∏è **Dead Code is Debt**
üî• Regularly delete unused code, legacy assets, stale test files, or experimental stubs.
‚ùå "Just in case" or "might be useful later" is not a valid reason to keep clutter.
üß™ Temporary test code must be removed or clearly gated (e.g. with feature flags or development-only checks).

üß™ **Use Tools to Automate Discipline**
‚úÖ Mandatory for all contributors:
- Linters: ESLint, Flake8, RuboCop
- Formatters: Prettier, Black, gofmt
- Static analysis: TypeScript, mypy, SonarQube, Bandit
- Dependency managers: pip-tools, Poetry, pnpm, npm lockfiles
- Schema enforcement: JSON schema, Pydantic, zod
- Test coverage tooling: Jest, pytest-cov, Istanbul

üîÑ Integrate these tools in pre-commit, pre-push, and CI/CD workflows:
- No code gets into production branches without passing hygiene checks.
- Every PR should be green and self-explanatory.

‚úçÔ∏è **Commits Are Contracts**
‚úÖ Write atomic commits‚Äîone logical change per commit.
üßæ Follow conventional commit patterns or similar style guides (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.).
üß™ No skipping reviews or tests for "quick fixes." These introduce long-term chaos.

üß† **Execution Mindset: Act Like a Top-Level Engineer**
üõ†Ô∏è Think like an Architect, Engineer, QA, and PM‚Äîall at once.
üî¨ Examine the full context of any change before writing code.
üß≠ Prioritize long-term clarity over short-term speed.
üß± Every change should make the codebase easier to maintain for someone else later.

üö© **Red Flags (Anti-Patterns to Avoid)**
üî¥ "I'll just put this here for now" ‚Äî No, there is no "for now."
üî¥ "It's just a tiny change" ‚Äî That's how tech debt begins.
üî¥ "We can clean this up later" ‚Äî "Later" rarely comes.
üî¥ Duplicate modules named utils.js, helper.py, or service.ts across packages.
üî¥ PRs that include: unrelated changes, commented-out code, unreviewed temporary logs.

üß≠ **Final Reminder**
A healthy codebase is a shared responsibility.
Every line of code you touch should be better than you found it.

### üö´ Rules to Follow

#### üìå Rule 1: No conceptual Elements
‚ú® Only real, production-ready implementations are allowed.
Do not write speculative, placeholder, "in-theory," or overly abstract code unless it's been fully validated and grounded in current platform constraints.

‚ú® Avoid overengineering or unnecessary abstraction.
No fictional components, fake classes, dream APIs, or imaginary infrastructure. All code must reflect actual, working systems.

‚ú® No 'someday' solutions.
Avoid comments like // TODO: automatically scale this later or // configure this to uses a future AI module. If it doesn't exist now, it doesn't go in the codebase.

‚ú® Be honest with the present limitations.
Code must work today, not in a hypothetical perfect setup. Assume real-world constraints like flaky hardware, latency, cold starts, and limited memory.
All code and documentation must use real, grounded constructs‚Äîno metaphors, automated terms, or hypothetical "encapsulated" AI.

‚ú® **Forbidden:**
- Terms like configurationService, automationHandler, transferData(), or comments such as // TODO: add automation here.
- Pseudo-functions that don't map to an actual library or API (e.g. intelligentSystem.optimize()).

‚ú® **Mandated Practices:**
- Name things concretely: emailSender, not mailService.
- Use real libraries: import from nodemailer, not from "the mail service integration."
- Link to docs in comments or README‚Äîevery external API or framework must be verifiable.

‚úÖ **Pre-Commit Checks:**
- Search for banned keywords (automated, configuration, encapsulated, etc.) in your diff.
- Verify every new dependency is in package.json (or requirements.txt) with a valid version.
- Ensure code examples in docs actually compile or run.

#### üìå Rule 2: Do Not Break Existing Functionality
‚ú® Every change must respect what already works.
Before modifying any file, component, or flow, verify exactly what it currently does and why. Don't assume anything.

‚ú® Regression = failure.
If your change breaks or downgrades existing features‚Äîeven temporarily‚Äîit's considered a critical issue. Stability comes first.

‚ú® Backwards compatibility is a must.
If your refactor or feature update changes existing behavior, either support legacy use cases or migrate them gracefully.

‚ú® Always test before merging.
Write or update test cases to explicitly cover both new logic and old logic. Nothing ships unless it's verified to not break production behavior.

‚ú® Communicate impact clearly.
If there's any risk of side effects, escalate and document. Silent changes are forbidden.

üîç Before modifying any file, investigate the full functionality and behavior of the existing code‚Äîunderstand what it does, how it's used, and whether it's actively supporting a feature or integration.

üß™ If a change is required, test the full end-to-end flow before and after. Confirm the logic is preserved or improved‚Äînever regressed.

üîÅ Refactor only when necessary and with proper safeguards. If existing advanced functionality is present (e.g., dynamic routing, lazy loading, caching, etc.), it must be preserved or enhanced, not removed.

üìä Maintain proper version control and rollback strategies in case a new change introduces instability or conflict.

üí° Document what was changed, why, and what was verified to ensure that others won't unknowingly override or disrupt a critical flow later.

‚ùó Breaking changes must never be merged without full validation across all dependent systems and deployment scenarios.
Every change must preserve or improve current behavior‚Äîno regressions, ever.

‚ú® **Investigation Steps:**
- Trace usage:
  - grep -R "functionName" .
  - Check import graphs or IDE "Find Usages."
- Run baseline tests:
  - npm test, pytest, or your CI suite.
  - Manual sanity check of any affected UI or API endpoints.
- Review consumers:
  - Frontend pages that call an endpoint
  - Cron jobs or scripts that rely on a helper

‚ú® **Testing & Safeguards:**
- Write or update tests covering both old and new behavior.
- Gate big changes behind feature flags until fully validated.
- Prepare a rollback plan‚Äîdocument the exact revert commit or steps.

‚úÖ **Merge Criteria:**
- Green build with 100% test pass rate
- No new lint/type errors
- Explicit sign-off from the original feature owner or lead

‚ùó Do Not merge breaking changes without:
- A clear "Breaking Change" section in the PR description
- A migration or upgrade guide in CHANGELOG.md or docs

#### üìå Rule 3: Analyze Everything‚ÄîEvery Time
‚ú® A thorough, deep review of the entire application is required before any change is made.
‚ú® Check all files, folders, scripts, directories, configuration files, pipelines, logs, and documentation without exception.
‚ú® Do not rely on assumptions‚Äîvalidate every piece of code logic, every dependency, every API interaction, and every test.
‚ú® Document what you find, and do not move forward until you have a complete understanding of the system.

#### üìå Rule 4: Reuse Before Creating
‚ú® Always check if a script or piece of code already exists before creating a new one.
‚ú® If it exists, use it or improve it‚Äîdon't duplicate it. No more script chaos where there are five different versions of the same functionality scattered across the codebase.

#### üìå Rule 5: Treat This as a Professional Project ‚Äî Not a Playground
‚ú® This is not a testing ground or experimental repository. Every change must be done with a professional mindset‚Äîno trial-and-error, no haphazard additions, and no skipping steps.
‚ú® Respect the structure, follow established standards, and treat this like you would a high-stakes production system.

#### üìå Rule 6: Clear, Centralized, and Structured Documentation
‚ú® All documentation must be in a central /docs/ directory with a logical folder structure.
‚ú® Update documentation as part of every change‚Äîno exceptions.
‚ú® Do not leave outdated documentation lying around. Remove it immediately or update it to reflect the current state.
‚ú® Ownership and collaboration: Make it clear what each document is for, who owns it, and when it was last updated.

#### üìå Rule 7: Eliminate Script Chaos ‚Äî Clean, Consolidate, and Control
‚ú® We will not tolerate script sprawl. All scripts must be:
‚Ä¢ Centralized in a single, well-organized /scripts/ directory.
‚Ä¢ Categorized clearly (e.g., /scripts/deployment/, /scripts/testing/, /scripts/utils/).
‚Ä¢ Named descriptively and purposefully.
‚Ä¢ Documented with headers explaining their purpose, usage, and dependencies.
‚ú® Remove all unused scripts. If you find duplicates, consolidate them into one.
‚ú® Scripts should have one purpose and do it well. No monolithic, do-everything scripts.

#### üìå Rule 8: Python Script Sanity ‚Äî Structure, Purpose, and Cleanup
‚ú® Python scripts must:
‚Ä¢ Be organized into a clear location (e.g., /scripts/python/ or within specific module directories).
‚Ä¢ Include proper headers: purpose, author, date, usage instructions.
‚Ä¢ Use argparse or similar for CLI arguments‚Äîno hardcoded values.
‚Ä¢ Handle errors gracefully with logging.
‚Ä¢ Be production-ready, not quick hacks.
‚ú® Delete all test scripts, debugging scripts, and one-off experiments from the repository. If you need them temporarily, use a separate branch or local environment.

#### üìå Rule 9: Backend & Frontend Version Control ‚Äî No More Duplication Chaos
‚ú® There should be one and only one source of truth for the backend and frontend.
‚ú® Remove all v1, v2, v3, old, backup, deprecated versions immediately.
‚ú® If you need to experiment, use branches and feature flags‚Äînot duplicate directories.

#### üìå Rule 10: Functionality-First Cleanup ‚Äî Never Delete Blindly
‚ú® Before removing any code, script, or file:
‚Ä¢ Verify all references and dependencies.
‚Ä¢ Understand its purpose and usage.
‚Ä¢ Test the system without it to ensure nothing breaks.
‚Ä¢ Archive before deletion if there's any doubt.
‚ú® Do not delete advanced functionality that works (e.g., caching, optimization, monitoring) just because you don't understand it immediately. Investigate first.

#### üìå Rule 11: Docker Structure Must Be Clean, Modular, and Predictable
‚ú® All Docker-related files must follow a consistent structure:
‚Ä¢ Dockerfiles should be optimized, multi-stage where appropriate, and well-commented.
‚Ä¢ docker-compose.yml files must be modular and environment-specific (dev, staging, prod).
‚Ä¢ Use .dockerignore properly to exclude unnecessary files.
‚Ä¢ Version-pin all base images and dependencies.

#### üìå Rule 12: One Self-Updating, Intelligent, End-to-End Deployment Script
‚ú® Create and maintain a single deploy.sh script that:
‚Ä¢ Is self-sufficient and comprehensive.
‚Ä¢ Handles all environments (dev, staging, production) with appropriate flags.
‚Ä¢ Is self-updating‚Äîpulls the latest changes and updates itself before running.
‚Ä¢ Provides clear logging, error handling, and rollback capabilities.
‚Ä¢ Is documented inline and in /docs/deployment/.
‚ú® No more scattered deployment scripts. One script to rule them all.

#### üìå Rule 13: No Garbage, No Rot
‚ú® Abandoned code, TODO comments older than 30 days, commented-out blocks, and unused imports/variables must be removed.
‚ú® If it's not being used, it doesn't belong in the codebase.
‚ú® Regular cleanup sprints will be enforced.

#### üìå Rule 14: Engage the Correct AI Agent for Every Task
‚ú® We have specialized AI agents. Use them appropriately:
‚Ä¢ Backend tasks ‚Üí Backend specialist
‚Ä¢ Frontend tasks ‚Üí Frontend specialist
‚Ä¢ DevOps tasks ‚Üí DevOps specialist
‚Ä¢ Documentation ‚Üí Documentation specialist
‚ú® Do not use a generalist agent for specialized work when a specialist is available.
‚ú® Document which agent was used for which task in commit messages.

#### üìå Rule 15: Keep Documentation Clean, Clear, and Deduplicated
‚ú® Documentation must be:
‚Ä¢ Clear and concise‚Äîno rambling or redundancy.
‚Ä¢ Up-to-date‚Äîreflects the current state of the system.
‚Ä¢ Structured‚Äîfollows a consistent format and hierarchy.
‚Ä¢ Actionable‚Äîprovides clear next steps, not just descriptions.
‚ú® Remove all duplicate documentation immediately. There should be one source of truth for each topic.

#### üìå Rule 16: Use Local LLMs Exclusively via Ollama, Default to TinyLlama
‚ú® All AI/LLM operations must use Ollama with locally hosted models.
‚ú® Default model: TinyLlama (fast, efficient, sufficient for most tasks).
‚ú® Document any model overrides clearly in configuration and code comments.
‚ú® No external API calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other cloud providers without explicit approval and documentation.

#### üìå Rule 17: Review and Follow All Documents in /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT
‚ú® The /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT directory contains canonical documentation that must be reviewed before making any changes.
‚ú® These documents represent the source of truth and override any conflicting information elsewhere.
‚ú® If you find discrepancies, the IMPORTANT/ documents win.

#### üìå Rule 18: Absolute, Line-by-Line Deep Review of Core Documentation
‚ú® Before starting any work, you must perform a line-by-line review of:
‚Ä¢ /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md
‚Ä¢ /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/*
‚Ä¢ Project README files
‚Ä¢ Architecture documentation
‚ú® This is not optional. Zero tolerance for skipping this step.
‚ú® Document your understanding and any discrepancies found.

#### üìå Rule 19: Mandatory Change Tracking in /opt/sutazaiapp/docs/CHANGELOG.md
‚ú® Every single change, no matter how small, must be documented in the CHANGELOG.
‚ú® Format: [Date] - [Version] - [Component] - [Change Type] - [Description]
‚ú® Include:
‚Ä¢ What was changed
‚Ä¢ Why it was changed
‚Ä¢ Who made the change (AI agent or human)
‚Ä¢ Potential impact or dependencies
‚ú® No exceptions. Undocumented changes will be reverted.
