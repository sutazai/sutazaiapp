âœ… Codebase Standards & Implementation Checklist
ðŸ”§ Codebase Hygiene
 Ensure the codebase is clean, consistent, and well-organized.

 Avoid creating multiple or conflicting versions of:

 Backend code

 Frontend code

 Scripts

 Requirements

 Documentation

 Use all available tools and agents to enforce consistency across all areas.

ðŸ§  Execution Mindset
 Approach your work as a top-tier AI Senior Architect, Product Manager, Developer, Engineer, QA Tester.

 Execute with precision.

 Avoid mistakesâ€”be methodical and deliberate with every implementation.

ðŸš« Rules to Follow
ðŸ“Œ Rule 1: No Fantasy Elements
 Do not introduce or reference any fantasy elementsâ€”this is a strict rule.

 Focus only on real, production-ready implementation.

ðŸ“Œ Rule 2: Do Not Break Existing Functionality
 Never disrupt or degrade existing advanced features.

 Investigate functionality in full before making any changes.

ðŸ“Œ Rule 3: Analyze Everythingâ€”Every Time
Always conduct a thorough and systematic review of the entire application before proceeding.

Files

 Ensure naming conventions are consistent and meaningful

 Remove redundant or obsolete files

 Verify file dependencies and imports

Folders

 Maintain a clear, logical folder structure

 Avoid duplication of modules or components

 Group related functionality properly

Scripts

 Check for reusability and maintainability

 Confirm scripts are version-controlled and documented

 Validate script execution paths and environment variables

Directories

 Ensure consistent layout across environments (dev, staging, prod)

 Remove unused or temporary directories

 Audit for unnecessary nesting and flatten where possible

Code Logic

 Scrutinize conditionals, loops, and function logic for accuracy and efficiency

 Validate edge-case handling and error management

 Check for unnecessary complexityâ€”simplify where possible

 Confirm logic is testable and covered by unit/integration tests

Dependencies & Packages

 Validate all installed packages are in use and up to date

 Remove deprecated or unused dependencies

 Verify security and license compliance

APIs & Integrations

 Confirm external APIs are stable and well-documented

 Check rate limits, error handling, and retry logic

 Validate data mappings and transformation layers

Configuration Files

 Ensure all environment-specific settings are properly scoped

 Avoid hard-coded secretsâ€”use secure environment variables

 Check for misconfigured flags or unused parameters

Build/Deployment Pipelines

 Audit CI/CD pipelines for completeness and reliability

 Ensure testing, linting, and rollback mechanisms are in place

 Check for consistency across branches and environments

Logs & Monitoring

 Confirm logging is present, relevant, and not excessive

 Ensure sensitive data is never logged

 Verify monitoring and alerting are properly configured

Testing Coverage

 Validate coverage reports and ensure tests are passing

 Confirm all new or modified logic is properly tested

 Check for flaky or redundant tests

 Ensure everything is functioning 100% correctly before proceeding.

ðŸ“Œ Rule 4: Reuse Before Creating
 Always check for and reuse existing scripts.

 Only create new scripts if absolutely necessaryâ€”and only when no existing solution fits.
ðŸ“Œ Rule 5: Treat This as a Professional Project â€” Not a Playground
 Approach every task with a professional mindsetâ€”this is not an experiment or personal sandbox.

 Do not treat the codebase as a place for trial-and-error coding, shortcuts, or sloppy work.

 Respect the structure, standards, and long-term maintainability of the project.

 Every decision must be intentional, reviewed, and aligned with best practices.
