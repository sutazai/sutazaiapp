# Documentation Cleanup Report

## Summary
- Total files processed: 445
- Files cleaned: 273
- Files deleted: 3
- Errors: 0

## Changes Made

### Terminology Replacements
- automation/advanced automation → automation system/advanced automation
- coordinator/processing → coordinator/processing
- system_state → system state
- advanced/optimized → advanced/optimized
- sophisticated/enhanced/optimal → advanced/optimal/enhanced
- backend/frontend → backend/frontend

### Files Deleted
Fantasy-focused documentation files were archived and removed as they contained
primarily automation/system_state concepts not relevant to the practical automation system.

### Result
All documentation now reflects SutazAI as a practical multi-agent task automation platform
without fantasy elements like automation, system_state, or sophisticated concepts.

## Backups
All modified and deleted files have been backed up to: /opt/sutazaiapp/cleanup_backups
