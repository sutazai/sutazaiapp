# SutazAI Security Module

## Overview

The SutazAI Security Module provides a comprehensive, multi-layered security framework designed to protect the system from various threats and vulnerabilities. This module integrates advanced threat detection, real-time monitoring, and proactive security measures.

## Key Components

### 1. Threat Detector (`threat_detector.py`)

#### Features
- Network Anomaly Detection
- Process Behavior Monitoring
- IP Reputation Checking
- Encrypted Security Event Logging
- Continuous Security Scanning

#### Threat Detection Mechanisms
- Suspicious Port Monitoring
- High Resource Usage Detection
- Malicious Command Line Identification
- External IP Reputation Verification

### 2. Configuration Management

The security module uses a flexible configuration system that allows:
- Customizable threat sensitivity
- Configurable suspicious port list
- IP blacklisting and whitelisting
- Logging and encryption settings

### 3. Logging and Reporting

- Encrypted security event logs
- Detailed threat reports
- Performance and resource utilization tracking

## Usage Example

```python
from core_system.security.threat_detector import ThreatDetector

# Initialize threat detector
threat_detector = ThreatDetector(
    log_dir='custom_security_logs',
    config_path='custom_security_config.json'
)

# Run comprehensive threat scan
threats = threat_detector.run_comprehensive_threat_scan()

# Start continuous monitoring
threat_detector.start_continuous_monitoring(interval=30)
```

## Configuration Options

Create a `security_config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
    "max_failed_logins": 5,
    "suspicious_ports": [22, 23, 3389],
    "blacklisted_ips": [],
    "whitelisted_ips": [],
    "threat_sensitivity": "medium"
}
```

## Security Best Practices

1. Regularly update the threat detection rules
2. Monitor and analyze security logs
3. Keep the configuration flexible but restrictive
4. Use strong, unique encryption keys
5. Implement multi-factor authentication

## Dependencies

- `psutil` for system monitoring
- `requests` for external IP reputation checks
- `cryptography` for secure logging
- `logging` for comprehensive event tracking

## Performance Considerations

The threat detection system is designed to be lightweight and non-intrusive, with configurable scan intervals and minimal system overhead.

## Future Roadmap

- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Integration with external security information and event management (SIEM) systems
- Enhanced network traffic analysis
- More granular process and network monitoring
