# Changelog

All notable changes to the Service Mesh module will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-16

### Added
- **MAJOR**: Implemented real production-grade service mesh (`service_mesh.py`)
  - Service discovery with Consul integration
  - Multiple load balancing strategies (round-robin, least connections, weighted, random, IP hash)
  - Circuit breaker pattern implementation for fault tolerance
  - Automatic health checking and instance management
  - Service registration and deregistration
  - Request/response interceptors for middleware functionality
- **Distributed Tracing** (`distributed_tracing.py`)
  - Span creation and management with OpenTelemetry-compatible format
  - Trace context propagation via HTTP headers
  - Service dependency mapping
  - Trace collector with search capabilities
  - Performance metrics collection
- **Service Mesh Dashboard** (`mesh_dashboard.py`)
  - Real-time service topology visualization
  - Service and mesh-level metrics tracking
  - Alert generation based on health thresholds
  - Historical metrics for trend analysis
  - Service dependency graph generation
- **New API Endpoints** (`mesh_v2.py`)
  - `/api/v1/mesh/v2/register` - Register services
  - `/api/v1/mesh/v2/discover/{service}` - Discover service instances
  - `/api/v1/mesh/v2/call` - Call services through mesh
  - `/api/v1/mesh/v2/topology` - Get mesh topology
  - `/api/v1/mesh/v2/health` - Mesh health status
  - `/api/v1/mesh/v2/metrics` - Prometheus metrics
  - `/api/v1/mesh/v2/configure/*` - Configuration endpoints
- Comprehensive test suite (`test_service_mesh.py`)
- Kong API Gateway integration for routing
- Consul service discovery integration

### Changed
- Original Redis-based implementation (`redis_bus.py`) retained for backward compatibility
- API router updated to include both v1 (Redis) and v2 (real mesh) endpoints

### Deprecated
- Redis-only "mesh" implementation will be phased out in v3.0.0
- Legacy `/api/v1/mesh/enqueue` endpoint (use v2 service calls instead)

### Fixed
- Replaced fake Redis queue with actual service mesh infrastructure
- Added proper service discovery instead of static configuration
- Implemented real load balancing instead of random selection
- Added circuit breaking for fault isolation
- Implemented distributed tracing for request correlation

### Security
- Service-to-service authentication preparation (hooks in place)
- Secure service registration with health checks
- Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-15

- Core functionality established
- Documentation created
- Tests implemented where applicable

### Changed
- Migrated from legacy structure
- Updated to follow enforcement rules

### Fixed

- Corrected error handling

### Security
