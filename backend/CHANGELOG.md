### Fixed

- 2025-08-16 23:37:00 UTC - **EMERGENCY FIX: MCP Status Endpoint 404 Error RESOLVED**
  - **Problem**: `/api/v1/mcp/status` endpoint returning 404 Not Found (missing from router)
  - **Root Cause**: Missing status endpoint definition in mcp.py router
  - **Fix Applied**: Added comprehensive `/status` endpoint with bridge status, service count, and infrastructure info
  - **Results**: 
    - `/api/v1/mcp/status` now returns 200 OK with full status information
    - Shows bridge type (DinDMeshBridge), initialization status, service count
    - Includes DinD availability and infrastructure status
    - Backend logs show successful endpoint registration
  - **SUCCESS RATE**: 100% - All core MCP endpoints now functional
    - ✅ `/api/v1/mcp/status` - 200 OK (FIXED)
    - ✅ `/api/v1/mcp/services` - 200 OK 
    - ✅ `/api/v1/mcp/health` - 200 OK
    - ✅ `/api/v1/mcp/dind/status` - 200 OK
  - **Impact**: Eliminates false failure reports, provides accurate system status

- 2025-08-16 23:04:00 UTC - **CRITICAL FIX: MCP API Endpoints 404 Error Resolved**
  - **Problem**: All /api/v1/mcp/* endpoints returning 404 Not Found
  - **Root Causes Identified and Fixed:**
    1. Logger referenced before definition in mcp.py (line 19)
    2. Syntax error in mcp_startup.py (misplaced else statement at line 168)
    3. Import path errors - using relative imports instead of absolute
    4. Missing docker dependency in requirements.txt
    5. Try/catch blocks hiding import failures in main.py
  - **Fixes Applied:**
    - Fixed logger initialization order in mcp.py
    - Corrected syntax error in mcp_startup.py
    - Changed relative imports to absolute imports (app.mesh.*)
    - Added docker==7.1.0 to requirements.txt
    - Enhanced error handling in main.py with fallback router
    - Added missing methods to DinDMeshBridge (health_check_all, get_service_status, etc.)
  - **Results:**
    - MCP endpoints now return 200 OK instead of 404
    - /api/v1/mcp/health working and showing service status
    - /api/v1/mcp/services returning empty list (no containers in DinD yet)
    - /api/v1/mcp/dind/status accessible and functional
    - Backend logs show: "MCP-Mesh Integration router loaded successfully"
  - **Testing Verified:**
    - 4 out of 5 test endpoints now working (80% success rate)
    - Previous: 0% success (all 404 errors)
    - Current: 80% success (only /api/v1/mcp/status undefined)
