### Fixed
- **2025-08-15 UTC**: Fixed NotImplementedError in agent_manager.py:822 - Replaced misleading NotImplementedError with proper ValueError when agent not found in update_agent_config method. Now provides clear error message indicating agent was not found and lists available agents.

### Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `/opt/sutazaiapp/backend/ai_agents/agent_manager.py`
- **Method**: `update_agent_config()`
- **Issue**: Line 822 raised NotImplementedError with misleading message "Agent {agent_id} does not support configuration updates" when agent doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Changed to ValueError with proper error message "Agent {agent_id} not found. Available agents: {list(self.agents.keys())}"
- **Additional**: Added proper error logging with logger.error() before raising exception
- **Compliance**: Follows Rule 8 logging standards and professional error handling patterns
