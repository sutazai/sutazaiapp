# Codebase Standards Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Immediate Setup (Week 1)

### 1.1 Automated Tooling Setup
```bash
# Install and configure all required tools
npm install -D eslint prettier husky lint-staged @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
pip install black flake8 mypy bandit safety pytest-cov
```

### 1.2 Pre-commit Hooks Configuration
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    hooks:
      - id: black
      
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
        args: ['--max-line-length=88']
        
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-eslint
    hooks:
      - id: eslint
        files: \.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$
```

### 1.3 CI/CD Pipeline Updates
```yaml
# .github/workflows/standards-enforcement.yml
name: Codebase Standards Enforcement

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality-gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Code Coverage Check
        run: |
          coverage run -m pytest
          coverage report --fail-under=80
          
      - name: Security Scanning
        run: |
          bandit -r backend/
          safety check
          trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .
          
      - name: Complexity Analysis
        run: |
          radon cc backend/ -nc --total-average
          
      - name: Documentation Check
        run: |
          python scripts/check_documentation.py
```

## Phase 2: Codebase Cleanup (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Dead Code Removal
```bash
# Use vulture to find dead code
vulture backend/ frontend/src/ --min-confidence 80

# Remove unused dependencies
npm prune
pip-autoremove
```

### 2.2 Consolidate Duplicate Logic
- Identify duplicate functions/components using tools like jscpd
- Create shared utilities modules
- Update all references to use centralized code

### 2.3 Script Organization
```bash
# Reorganize scripts into proper structure
mkdir -p scripts/{dev,deploy,data,utils,test}
# Move and rename scripts following conventions
```

## Phase 3: AI Agent Deployment (Week 4)

### 3.1 Deploy Monitoring Agents
```python
# Deploy testing-qa-validator for continuous quality checks
{
  "agent": "testing-qa-validator",
  "tasks": [
    "Monitor test coverage",
    "Validate code quality metrics",
    "Check for security vulnerabilities",
    "Enforce documentation standards"
  ],
  "schedule": "*/30 * * * *"  # Every 30 minutes
}

# Deploy code-generation-improver for code optimization
{
  "agent": "code-generation-improver",
  "tasks": [
    "Identify code duplication",
    "Suggest refactoring opportunities",
    "Optimize performance bottlenecks",
    "Improve code readability"
  ],
  "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"  # Every 6 hours
}
```

### 3.2 Deploy Infrastructure Agents
```python
# Deploy infrastructure-devops-manager for Docker and deployment
{
  "agent": "infrastructure-devops-manager",
  "tasks": [
    "Optimize Docker images",
    "Monitor container health",
    "Validate deployment scripts",
    "Check infrastructure resilience"
  ],
  "schedule": "0 */4 * * *"  # Every 4 hours
}

# Deploy system-optimizer-reorganizer for cleanup
{
  "agent": "system-optimizer-reorganizer",
  "tasks": [
    "Identify unused files",
    "Optimize folder structure",
    "Clean up temporary files",
    "Reorganize documentation"
  ],
  "schedule": "0 0 * * 0"  # Weekly
}
```

## Phase 4: Continuous Enforcement

### 4.1 Automated Metrics Dashboard
```yaml
# Grafana dashboard configuration
metrics:
  - code_coverage: >= 80%
  - security_vulnerabilities: 0 critical/high
  - build_success_rate: >= 95%
  - deployment_rollback_rate: < 5%
  - mean_time_to_recovery: < 5 minutes
  - documentation_coverage: >= 90%
```

### 4.2 Weekly AI Agent Reports
```python
# Weekly comprehensive analysis
{
  "agent": "ai-agent-orchestrator",
  "task": "Generate weekly codebase health report",
  "includes": [
    "Code quality trends",
    "Security posture",
    "Performance metrics",
    "Technical debt assessment",
    "Compliance violations",
    "Improvement recommendations"
  ]
}
```

## Success Metrics

### üö® BLOCKING Metrics (Must Pass)
- [ ] Test coverage >= 80%
- [ ] Zero critical/high security vulnerabilities
- [ ] All services have health checks
- [ ] Deployment script works on fresh system

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING Metrics (Track & Improve)
- [ ] Code complexity < 10 (cyclomatic)
- [ ] Documentation coverage >= 90%
- [ ] Docker image sizes optimized
- [ ] Resource usage within limits

### üìã GUIDANCE Metrics (Best Practices)
- [ ] Consistent code style (100% formatted)
- [ ] No duplicate code blocks > 50 lines
- [ ] All scripts documented
- [ ] Chaos tests passing

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Focus Area | Key Deliverables |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | Tooling Setup | Pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipeline |
| 2-3 | Cleanup & Organization | Dead code removed, scripts organized |
| 4 | AI Agent Deployment | Monitoring agents active |
| 5+ | Continuous Improvement | Weekly reports, ongoing optimization |

## Agent Responsibilities Matrix

| Standard | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent | Frequency |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Code Quality | testing-qa-validator | code-generation-improver | Continuous |
| Documentation | document-knowledge-manager | ai-agent-debugger | Daily |
| Security | security-pentesting-specialist | semgrep-security-analyzer | Hourly |
| Performance | system-optimizer-reorganizer | resource-visualiser | Daily |
| Docker | infrastructure-devops-manager | deployment-automation-master | Per commit |
| Deployment | deployment-automation-master | self-healing-orchestrator | Per deployment |
| Monitoring | observability-monitoring-engineer | intelligence-optimization-monitor | Real-time |
| Chaos Testing | testing-qa-validator | infrastructure-devops-manager | Daily |

## Enforcement Automation

### Git Hooks (Local)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push
# Runs before code is pushed

# Check for banned keywords
if grep -r "TODO.*magic\|wizard\|black-box" --include="*.py" --include="*.js"; then
  echo "‚ùå Fantasy elements detected. Please use concrete terms."
  exit 1
fi

# Verify tests pass
npm test && python -m pytest
```

### GitHub Actions (Remote)
```yaml
# Automated PR checks
- name: Enforce Standards
  uses: ./.github/actions/standards-check
  with:
    block_on_failure: true
    notify_slack: true
```

## Next Steps

1. Run `./scripts/initialize_standards.sh` to set up all tooling
2. Execute cleanup tasks using AI agents
3. Monitor metrics dashboard for compliance
4. Review weekly AI agent reports
5. Iterate and improve based on findings
