# SutazAI Comprehensive Codebase Standards & Enforcement Guide

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Stability First
- **NEVER** break existing functionality
- **NEVER** deploy without comprehensive testing
- **ALWAYS** maintain backward compatibility
- **ALWAYS** have rollback capability

### 2. Security by Design
- **ZERO** hardcoded secrets or credentials
- **MANDATORY** security scanning at every stage
- **REQUIRED** encryption at rest and in transit
- **ENFORCE** principle of least privilege

### 3. Quality Through Automation
- **AUTOMATE** all repetitive tasks
- **ENFORCE** standards through tooling
- **MEASURE** everything that matters
- **FAIL FAST** on quality violations

## 🚨 BLOCKING RULES (Automated Enforcement - Deployment Stops)

### 1. Zero Regression Policy
**Metrics:**
- All existing tests must pass (100% pass rate)
- Performance baselines must be maintained (±5%)
- Security vulnerabilities must be zero critical/high

**Enforcement:**
```yaml
ci_pipeline:
  blocking_gates:
    - test_coverage: ">= 80%"
    - security_scan: "no_critical_vulnerabilities"
    - performance_regression: "within_5_percent"
    - backward_compatibility: "verified"
```

### 2. Security Standards
**Requirements:**
- Static security analysis (SAST) - Semgrep, Bandit
- Dynamic security analysis (DAST) - OWASP ZAP
- Dependency vulnerability scanning - Snyk, Safety
- Container security scanning - Trivy, Grype
- Secrets detection - GitLeaks, TruffleHog

**Prohibited Patterns:**
```python
# BLOCKED by pre-commit hooks:
- eval(), exec(), or dynamic code execution
- SQL string concatenation
- Hardcoded passwords or API keys
- Disabled SSL/TLS verification
- Unrestricted file uploads
```

### 3. Performance Requirements
**Baselines:**
- API response time: p95 < 200ms, p99 < 500ms
- Memory usage: < 80% of allocated resources
- CPU usage: < 70% under normal load
- Database queries: All indexed and optimized

## ⚠️ WARNING RULES (Human Review Required)

### 4. Code Quality Standards
**Metrics:**
- Test coverage: minimum 80%
- Cyclomatic complexity: < 10
- Code duplication: < 5%
- Technical debt ratio: < 5%

**Required Tooling:**
```yaml
code_quality_tools:
  formatting:
    python: ["black", "isort"]
    javascript: ["prettier", "eslint"]
  linting:
    python: ["flake8", "pylint", "mypy"]
    javascript: ["eslint", "tslint"]
  security:
    all: ["semgrep", "bandit", "safety"]
```

### 5. Testing Standards
**Test Distribution:**
- Unit tests: 70%
- Integration tests: 20%
- End-to-end tests: 10%

**Test Requirements:**
```python
# Every module must have:
- Happy path tests
- Error condition tests
- Boundary value tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Security test cases
```

### 6. Documentation Standards
**Required Documentation:**
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Deployment procedures
- Incident response playbooks
- Security policies

## 📋 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Pre-Development Analysis
1. **Search for existing solutions first**
2. **Document approach in design doc**
3. **Threat model new features**
4. **Performance impact assessment**
5. **Security review for sensitive changes**

### During Development
1. **Atomic commits** - one logical change
2. **Conventional commits** - feat:, fix:, etc.
3. **Test-driven development** (TDD)
4. **Continuous integration** - push early and often
5. **Pair programming** for complex features

### Pre-Merge Requirements
1. **Code review** - minimum 2 approvals
2. **All tests passing** - 100% success
3. **Security scan clean** - no new vulnerabilities
4. **Performance validated** - no regression
5. **Documentation updated** - if applicable

## 🛠️ INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT

### Infrastructure as Code
**Requirements:**
```yaml
infrastructure_standards:
  provisioning:
    - tool: "Terraform or CloudFormation"
    - state: "Remote backend with locking"
    - testing: "Terratest validation"
  configuration:
    - tool: "Ansible or Chef"
    - secrets: "Vault or AWS Secrets Manager"
    - validation: "Pre-deployment checks"
```

### Container Standards
**Dockerfile Requirements:**
```dockerfile
# MANDATORY patterns:
FROM specific:version  # No 'latest' tags
RUN --mount=type=cache  # Use build cache
USER nonroot  # Never run as root
HEALTHCHECK  # Required for all services
```

### Deployment Strategy
**Blue-Green Deployment:**
```yaml
deployment_requirements:
  pre_deployment:
    - health_checks: "all_passing"
    - backup: "completed"
    - rollback_plan: "validated"
  deployment:
    - strategy: "blue_green_or_canary"
    - validation: "smoke_tests"
    - monitoring: "enhanced"
  post_deployment:
    - health_monitoring: "5_minutes"
    - performance_validation: "baseline_comparison"
    - user_validation: "synthetic_tests"
```

## 📊 OBSERVABILITY & MONITORING

### Three Pillars of Observability
**1. Metrics:**
```yaml
required_metrics:
  golden_signals:
    - latency: "request duration"
    - traffic: "requests per second"
    - errors: "error rate"
    - saturation: "resource utilization"
  custom_metrics:
    - business: "domain-specific KPIs"
    - user_experience: "real user monitoring"
```

**2. Logging:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "level": "INFO|WARN|ERROR",
  "trace_id": "correlation_id",
  "service": "service_name",
  "message": "structured_message",
  "context": {}
}
```

**3. Tracing:**
```yaml
distributed_tracing:
  - framework: "OpenTelemetry"
  - sampling: "adaptive"
  - storage: "Jaeger or Zipkin"
  - correlation: "across all services"
```

### Alerting Standards
**Alert Configuration:**
```yaml
alerting_rules:
  severity_levels:
    critical: "page on-call immediately"
    high: "notify team slack"
    medium: "create ticket"
    low: "dashboard only"
  required_fields:
    - description: "what is broken"
    - impact: "who is affected"
    - runbook: "how to fix"
```

## 🔒 SECURITY FRAMEWORK

### Security Controls
**Application Security:**
```yaml
security_requirements:
  authentication:
    - mfa: "required for production"
    - oauth2: "standard implementation"
    - session: "secure token management"
  authorization:
    - rbac: "role-based access control"
    - least_privilege: "minimum permissions"
    - audit: "all access logged"
  data_protection:
    - encryption_at_rest: "AES-256"
    - encryption_in_transit: "TLS 1.3"
    - key_management: "automated rotation"
```

### Compliance Requirements
**Standards:**
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- SOC 2 Type II controls
- GDPR/CCPA privacy requirements
- Industry-specific (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

## 🧪 QUALITY ASSURANCE

### Test Automation Framework
**Test Categories:**
```python
test_suite = {
    "unit": {
        "coverage": "80%",
        "execution": "< 5 minutes",
        "frequency": "every commit"
    },
    "integration": {
        "coverage": "critical paths",
        "execution": "< 15 minutes",
        "frequency": "every PR"
    },
    "performance": {
        "baseline": "established",
        "regression": "< 5%",
        "frequency": "nightly"
    },
    "security": {
        "scanning": "continuous",
        "penetration": "quarterly",
        "frequency": "every deployment"
    }
}
```

### Quality Gates
**Enforcement Points:**
1. **Pre-commit** - formatting, linting
2. **Pre-push** - unit tests, security scan
3. **Pull Request** - full test suite
4. **Pre-deployment** - integration, performance
5. **Post-deployment** - smoke tests, monitoring
