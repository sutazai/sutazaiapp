# Runtime Anomaly Detection Report - SutazAI Container Health Analysis

**Analysis Date:** August 5, 2025  
**System:** SutazAI Multi-Agent Platform  
**Environment:** Production (WSL2)

## Executive Summary

The SutazAI system is experiencing significant runtime anomalies with a persistent pattern of container health issues. Currently, only 27% of containers are healthy, with 30 containers in an unhealthy state. The system shows signs of cascading failures due to critical service dependencies being unavailable.

## Critical Anomalies Detected

### 1. Service Dependency Failures
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Pattern:** Cascading failures due to missing core services

- **Ollama Service:** Down - Cannot connect to any endpoint (localhost:11434, ollama:11434)
- **PostgreSQL Main:** Down - Connection refused on port 5432
- **Neo4j:** Down - Failed Bolt handshake on port 10003
- **PostgreSQL Hygiene:** Authentication failure on port 10020

**Impact:** 174+ AI agents depend on Ollama for LLM processing, causing widespread agent failures.

### 2. Container Health Check Timeouts
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Pattern:** Systematic health check failures across multiple agent containers

- **Affected Containers:** 30 unhealthy (70% of monitored containers)
- **Common Pattern:** Health checks timing out after 60s intervals
- **Restart Behavior:** Containers not restarting despite unhealthy state (0 restart count)

**Anomalous Containers:**
- All Phase 3 auxiliary agents (data-analysis, dify-automation, distributed-computing, etc.)
- Phase 2 specialized agents (attention-optimizer, cognitive-architecture-designer, etc.)
- Phase 1 core agents (ai-scrum-master, ai-product-manager, agentzero-coordinator)

### 3. Resource Consumption Patterns
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Pattern:** Inefficient resource utilization

- **Memory Usage:** 34.1% system-wide, but individual containers using only 6-7% of allocated 512MB
- **CPU Usage:** Very low (0.15-4.28%) indicating containers are idle or blocked
- **Memory Allocation:** Containers allocated 512MB but using only ~32MB (6.4% utilization)

### 4. Network Connectivity Issues
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Pattern:** Service discovery and inter-container communication failures

- Multiple services attempting localhost connections instead of container names
- Kong API Gateway healthy but upstream services unreachable
- Consul service discovery operational but not preventing connection failures

### 5. Authentication and Security Anomalies
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Pattern:** Credential mismatches and authentication failures

- PostgreSQL hygiene database rejecting connections with password authentication failure
- RabbitMQ management API returning 401 Unauthorized
- Rule Control API returning 404 for health endpoint

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Causes:

1. **Ollama Service Failure**: The Ollama service is the central LLM provider for all AI agents. Its failure causes a domino effect where all dependent agents become unhealthy.

2. **Database Connectivity**: Both PostgreSQL instances are down, preventing agents from persisting state and retrieving configuration.

3. **Health Check Configuration**: Health checks are configured with 60s intervals but no proper restart policies, causing containers to remain in unhealthy state indefinitely.

4. **Resource Constraints**: Despite low actual usage, memory limits (512MB per agent) may be insufficient during startup phases when loading models.

## Performance Impact

- **Service Availability:** 62.5% (10/16 critical services operational)
- **Agent Functionality:** 27% (12/44 agents healthy)
- **Response Times:** Degraded due to timeout cascades
- **System Load:** Low CPU usage indicates blocked operations rather than processing

## Health Monitor Statistics

Based on continuous monitoring:
- **Total Health Checks:** 728
- **Fixed Containers:** 589
- **Restart Attempts:** 5
- **Success Rate:** 80.9% fixes successful

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical):

1. **Restart Core Services**
   ```bash
   # Restart Ollama with proper configuration
   docker-compose up -d sutazai-ollama
   
   # Restart PostgreSQL services
   docker-compose up -d sutazai-postgres sutazai-postgres-hygiene
   
   # Restart Neo4j
   docker-compose up -d sutazai-neo4j
   ```

2. **Fix Health Check Policies**
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     interval: 30s
     timeout: 10s
     retries: 3
     start_period: 60s
   restart: unless-stopped
   ```

3. **Implement Dependency Ordering**
   ```yaml
   depends_on:
     sutazai-ollama:
       condition: service_healthy
     sutazai-postgres:
       condition: service_healthy
   ```

### Short-term Fixes (1-2 days):

1. **Resource Optimization**
   - Increase memory limits for AI agents to 1GB
   - Implement memory pooling for shared resources
   - Configure Ollama with 20GB memory allocation (as per previous fix)

2. **Service Mesh Configuration**
   - Update all services to use container names instead of localhost
   - Implement proper service discovery through Consul
   - Configure retry policies with exponential backoff

3. **Monitoring Enhancement**
   - Deploy permanent health monitor as systemd service
   - Implement automated container restart on health check failure
   - Add resource usage alerts at 80% threshold

### Long-term Improvements (1-2 weeks):

1. **Architecture Refactoring**
   - Implement circuit breakers for service dependencies
   - Deploy Ollama in high-availability cluster mode
   - Create agent pools with shared resource management

2. **Automated Recovery**
   - Implement self-healing mechanisms for common failures
   - Create automated rollback for failed deployments
   - Deploy chaos engineering tests to validate resilience

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching layer for LLM responses
   - Optimize container startup sequences
   - Deploy horizontal pod autoscaling for high-demand agents

## Monitoring Strategy

### Key Metrics to Track:
- Container health status (target: >95% healthy)
- Service dependency availability (target: 100% for critical services)
- Memory utilization efficiency (target: >50% of allocated)
- Response time percentiles (p95 < 2s, p99 < 5s)
- Restart frequency (target: <1 restart/day per container)

### Alerting Thresholds:
- Critical: >20% containers unhealthy for >5 minutes
- High: Any critical service down for >2 minutes
- Medium: Memory usage >80% sustained for >10 minutes
- Low: Health check latency >30s

## Conclusion

The SutazAI system is experiencing significant runtime anomalies primarily caused by core service failures and inadequate health check configurations. The cascading nature of these failures indicates a lack of proper dependency management and resilience patterns. Immediate action is required to restore core services and implement proper health check policies. The provided recommendations should be implemented in priority order to restore system stability and prevent future occurrences.
