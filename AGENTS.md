## üìä Agent Statistics

### Deployment Status
- **Total Available Agents**: 54+ in Claude Code
- **Currently Spawned**: 5 in active swarm
- **MCP Containers Running**: 13 (verified via docker ps)
- **Success Rate**: 75% (based on recent task completions)

## üöÄ How to Use Agents

### Via Task Tool (Recommended)
```javascript
Task({
  subagent_type: "system-architect",
  description: "Analyze system architecture",
  prompt: "Detailed task instructions..."
})
```

### Via MCP Claude-Flow
```javascript
// Initialize swarm
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init({ topology: "hierarchical", maxAgents: 10 })

// Spawn agent
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({ type: "architect", name: "system-architect" })

// Orchestrate task
mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate({ task: "Task description", priority: "high" })
```

## ‚úÖ Verified Agent Capabilities

Based on actual testing (2025-08-20):
- **Mock Cleanup**: Successfully removed production mocks
- **Docker Consolidation**: Reduced from 22 to 7 files
- **CHANGELOG Management**: Cleaned up 542 files
