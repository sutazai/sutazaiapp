## ðŸ”„ Major Rule Enhancements

### 1. **From Generic to Distributed-Specific**

#### Original Rule 3: "Analyze Everything"
```
Before: "Analyze files, folders, scripts, directories"
```

#### Improved Rule 3: "Distributed System Analysis Protocol"
```yaml
Now: Comprehensive analysis including:
- 69 agent health statuses
- Service mesh topology
- Resource allocation across 3 phases
- Port usage (10000-10599)
- Distributed state consistency
- Network partition risks
```

### 2. **From Basic Scripts to Distributed Management**

#### Original Rule 7: "Eliminate Script Chaos"
```
Before: "Keep scripts organized in /scripts folder"
```

#### Improved Rule 7: "Distributed Script Management"
```
Now: Category-based organization:
- /scripts/agents/ - Agent orchestration
- /scripts/monitoring/ - System monitoring
- /scripts/deployment/ - Phased deployment
- With concurrent execution safety and circuit breakers
```

### 3. **From Simple Agent Selection to Intelligent Routing**

#### Original Rule 14: "Engage Correct AI Agent"
```
Before: "Route task to most capable agent"
```

#### Improved Rule 14: "Agent Selection Protocol"
```
Now: Three-phase hierarchy with:
- Phase 1: Critical Core (15 agents)
- Phase 2: Performance Enhancement (25 agents)
- Phase 3: Specialized Functions (29 agents)
- Dynamic routing based on health and resources
```
