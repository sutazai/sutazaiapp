### Test Results:
```
==================================================
SutazAI Vector Database Tests
==================================================
ChromaDB: ✓ PASSED (v2 API working, v1 deprecated)
Qdrant:   ✓ PASSED (v1.15.4, all operations successful)
FAISS:    ✓ PASSED (health check working, API responsive)
==================================================
```
Test Script: `/opt/sutazaiapp/test_vector_databases.py`

### Fixes Applied:
1. **Consul**: Removed read-only volume mount to allow CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG writing
2. **Neo4j**: Changed health check from curl to wget (Alpine container compatibility)
3. **Kong**: Used existing PostgreSQL with dedicated 'kong' database
4. **Docker Network**: Fixed external network name to 'sutazaiapp_sutazai-network'
5. **FAISS Dockerfile**: Added APT retry/timeout configuration for slow networks
6. **FAISS LOG_LEVEL**: Fixed case sensitivity issue ('info' → 'INFO')
7. **Health Checks**: Removed for ChromaDB/Qdrant (containers lack curl/wget)

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ COMPLETED: Deploy ChromaDB vector store on port 10100
2. ✅ COMPLETED: Deploy Qdrant on ports 10101-10102  
3. ✅ COMPLETED: Deploy FAISS service on port 10103
4. 🔄 IN PROGRESS: Create FastAPI backend application
5. ⏳ PENDING: Deploy Streamlit Jarvis frontend
6. ⏳ PENDING: Clone and setup 20+ AI agents
