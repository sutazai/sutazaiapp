# Next Steps After Documentation Cleanup

## Current State Summary

✅ **Documentation is now 100% accurate**
✅ **All fantasy elements removed**
✅ **Configuration files consolidated**
✅ **Dependencies standardized**
✅ **System running with 28 healthy containers**

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Immediate Actions
- [ ] Fix ChromaDB connection issue
- [ ] Rebuild Docker images with new dependencies: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
- [ ] Test all services after rebuild
- [ ] Commit these documentation changes to git

### 2. Short-term Improvements (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Replace stub agents with actual implementations
- [ ] Add real AI functionality to at least 5 agents
- [ ] Implement proper inter-agent communication
- [ ] Create integration tests for core services
- [ ] Set up proper CI/CD pipeline

### 3. Medium-term Goals (1-2 months)
- [ ] Implement actual task orchestration
- [ ] Add more capable LLM models to Ollama
- [ ] Build real agent capabilities (not stubs)
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Implement proper authentication/authorization

### 4. Long-term Vision (3-6 months)
- [ ] Build actual AI agent functionality
- [ ] Implement distributed task processing
- [ ] Add real monitoring and observability
- [ ] Create production-ready deployment
- [ ] Build user-friendly interfaces

## Development Guidelines

### DO:
- ✅ Implement real features before documenting them
- ✅ Test thoroughly before claiming capabilities
- ✅ Keep documentation honest and updated
- ✅ Use the standardized dependency versions
- ✅ Follow the established port allocation strategy

### DON'T:
- ❌ Add fantasy documentation
- ❌ Claim non-existent features
- ❌ Create duplicate configuration files
- ❌ Use conflicting dependency versions
- ❌ Promise AGI or quantum capabilities

## Quick Reference

### Starting the System:
```bash
# Core services only
docker-compose up -d

# With monitoring
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d

# Check health
curl http://localhost:10010/health
```

- Frontend UI: http://localhost:10011
- Prometheus: http://localhost:10200
- Grafana: http://localhost:10201

### Working with Agents:
Remember: All current "agents" are stubs. To make them functional:
1. Pick an agent directory (e.g., `/agents/ai-senior-engineer/`)
2. Replace the stub `app.py` with real implementation
3. Connect to Ollama for actual AI capabilities
4. Implement proper request/response handling
5. Add integration tests

## Success Metrics

Track progress by:
- Number of stub agents replaced with real implementations
- API endpoints with actual functionality
- Test coverage percentage
- Documentation accuracy (maintain at 100%)
- System uptime and stability

**Remember**: The foundation is now clean and honest. Build real features on this solid base!
