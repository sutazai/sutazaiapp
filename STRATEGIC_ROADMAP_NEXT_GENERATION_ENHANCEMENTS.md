## Gap Analysis: Current State vs. Future Vision

### Technical Gaps

| Capability | Current State | Target State | Gap |
|------------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| **Computing Paradigm** | Classical CPU-only (12 cores) | Quantum-classical hybrid | Need quantum integration layer |
| **Energy Efficiency** | Traditional von Neumann architecture | Neuromorphic brain-inspired | Lacking spike-based processing |
| **Model Governance** | Centralized versioning | Blockchain-based provenance | No decentralized trust layer |
| **Intelligence Level** | Narrow AI (task-specific) | AGI with general reasoning | Missing cognitive architecture |
| **Coordination** | Orchestrated agents | Swarm intelligence | No emergent behavior framework |
| **Learning** | Supervised/federated | Self-supervised meta-learning | Limited autonomous improvement |
| **Security** | Traditional cybersecurity | Quantum-resistant + AGI safety | No AGI alignment mechanisms |

### Operational Gaps

1. **Resource Constraints**: CPU-only limitation prevents GPU/TPU acceleration
2. **Activation Rate**: Only 50.4% of discovered agents are active (69/137)
3. **Single LLM Bottleneck**: Ollama serving all agents through single instance
4. **Limited Autonomy**: Agents require human orchestration for complex tasks
5. **No Self-Modification**: System cannot autonomously improve its architecture
