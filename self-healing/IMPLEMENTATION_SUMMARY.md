## 🚀 Usage

### Deploy the System
```bash
cd /opt/sutazaiapp/self-healing/scripts
chmod +x deploy-self-healing.sh
./deploy-self-healing.sh
```

### Monitor Status
```bash
# Check overall status
curl http://localhost:8200/status | jq

# View circuit breakers
curl http://localhost:8200/circuit-breakers | jq

# Check feature flags
curl http://localhost:8200/feature-flags | jq
```

### Toggle Features
```bash
# Disable a feature
curl -X POST http://localhost:8200/feature-flags/ai_suggestions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'

# Reset circuit breaker
curl -X POST http://localhost:8200/circuit-breakers/backend/reset
```

## 📈 Metrics Available

The self-healing system exports the following Prometheus metrics:
- `self_healing_predictions_total` - Total predictions made
- `self_healing_anomaly_score` - Current anomaly scores
- `self_healing_resource_prediction` - Predicted resource usage
- `self_healing_failure_probability` - Service failure probability
- `circuit_breaker_state` - Circuit breaker states
- `feature_flag_enabled` - Feature flag status

## 🔧 Configuration

All configuration is in `/opt/sutazaiapp/self-healing/config/self-healing-config.yaml`:
- Circuit breaker thresholds and timeouts
- Feature flag defaults and fallback strategies
- Recovery procedures and triggers
- Predictive monitoring sensitivity
- Alert routing and channels

## 📝 Integration Points

1. **Docker Health Checks**: Integrates with existing Docker health checks
2. **Prometheus Monitoring**: Exports metrics to existing Prometheus
3. **Chaos Engineering**: Works with chaos experiments for testing
4. **Deployment Script**: Compatible with master deployment script
