# Self-Healing Architecture for SutazAI

This directory implements comprehensive self-healing capabilities for the SutazAI platform, providing automated recovery, circuit breakers, graceful degradation, and predictive failure detection.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Monitors service health and automatically opens circuits when failures exceed thresholds
- Implements half-open state for gradual recovery testing
- Configurable failure thresholds and timeout periods

### 2. Graceful Degradation
- Feature flags for non-critical functionality
- Cache-based fallback responses during outages
- Reduced functionality modes to maintain core services

### 3. Automated Recovery
- Self-diagnostic health checks across all services
- Automatic service remediation procedures
- Database connection pool recovery
- Memory leak detection and correction

### 4. Predictive Monitoring
- Resource exhaustion prevention
- Performance anomaly detection
- Dependency health tracking
- Trend analysis for proactive intervention

## Quick Start

```bash
# Deploy self-healing components
./scripts/deploy-self-healing.sh

# Configure circuit breakers
./scripts/configure-circuit-breakers.sh

# Enable graceful degradation
./scripts/enable-graceful-degradation.sh

# Start predictive monitoring
./scripts/start-predictive-monitoring.sh
```

## Configuration

Edit `config/self-healing-config.yaml` to customize:
- Circuit breaker thresholds
- Recovery strategies
- Feature flag settings
- Monitoring intervals

## Integration

The self-healing system integrates with:
- Docker health checks
- Prometheus monitoring
- Chaos engineering framework
- Deployment scripts

## Components

- **scripts/**: Executable scripts for self-healing operations
- **config/**: Configuration files for all components
- **monitoring/**: Predictive monitoring and alerting
- **recovery/**: Automated recovery procedures
