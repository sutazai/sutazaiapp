# Ollama Integration Deployment Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive zero-downtime deployment strategy for integrating the enhanced BaseAgentV2 with Ollama across all 131 agents in the SutazAI system. The deployment ensures 100% reliability through blue-green deployment patterns, canary rollouts, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Current State Analysis

### Infrastructure Overview
- **Total Agents**: 131 active agents
- **Hardware**: WSL2 environment with 48GB RAM, 4GB GPU
- **Current Base**: Legacy BaseAgent (synchronous)
- **Target Base**: BaseAgentV2 (async with Ollama integration)
- **Ollama Config**: OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=2 (resource-optimized)

### Agent Distribution
- **Production Agents**: 131 containers currently active
- **Legacy Base**: `/opt/sutazaiapp/agents/agent_base.py`
- **Enhanced Base**: `/opt/sutazaiapp/agents/core/base_agent_v2.py`
- **Agent Types**: Mixed specializations (AI, DevOps, QA, Security, etc.)

## Deployment Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **Zero Downtime**: No service interruption during migration
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Phased deployment with validation at each stage
3. **Instant Rollback**: Ability to revert at any point within 60 seconds
4. **Resource Awareness**: Respect hardware limitations (48GB RAM, 4GB GPU)
5. **Monitoring First**: Comprehensive observability throughout process

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Canary Deployment (10% - 13 agents)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Agents**: Lowest-risk agents (monitoring, logging, metrics)
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - 0% error rate increase
  - Response time < 2x baseline
  - Memory usage within 120% of baseline
  - All health checks passing

### Phase 2: Limited Rollout (25% - 32 agents)
- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- **Agents**: Development and testing agents
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Canary metrics maintained
  - No circuit breaker trips
  - Ollama connection pool stable

### Phase 3: Production Rollout (50% - 65 agents)
- **Duration**: 60 minutes
- **Agents**: Business logic and API agents
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Previous phase metrics maintained
  - Task processing rate maintained
  - No resource exhaustion

### Phase 4: Full Deployment (100% - 131 agents)
- **Duration**: 75 minutes
- **Agents**: All remaining agents including critical systems
- **Success Criteria**:
  - All agents healthy
  - System performance at or above baseline
  - Complete migration validated

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Resource Exhaustion**: Limited RAM/GPU could cause OOM
2. **Ollama Overload**: Parallel requests exceeding capacity
3. **Circuit Breaker Cascade**: Failures propagating across agents
4. **Network Congestion**: Increased HTTP connections
5. **State Inconsistency**: Mixed BaseAgent versions during transition

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time memory/CPU tracking with auto-rollback
2. **Ollama Rate Limiting**: Respect OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=2 constraint
3. **Circuit Breaker Configuration**: Conservative thresholds during deployment
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections efficiently
5. **Atomic Swaps**: Each agent transitions completely or not at all

## Success Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- **Task Processing Rate**: >= 95% of baseline
- **Response Time P95**: <= 150% of baseline
- **Error Rate**: <= 0.1% increase
- **Memory Usage**: <= 120% of baseline per agent
- **CPU Usage**: <= 110% of baseline
- **Ollama Success Rate**: >= 99%

### Business Metrics
- **Agent Availability**: 100% uptime
- **Task Completion Rate**: >= 99.5%
- **System Stability**: No emergency rollbacks
- **User Experience**: No noticeable degradation

## Rollback Strategy

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Memory usage > 90% of available
- Error rate > 5% for any agent type
- Ollama connection failures > 10%
- Circuit breaker trips > 3 per minute
- Health check failures > 2 consecutive

### Rollback Process
1. **Immediate Stop**: Halt current phase deployment
2. **Traffic Shift**: Route to stable (blue) environment
3. **Container Swap**: Replace enhanced agents with legacy
4. **Validation**: Confirm system stability
5. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis for retry

### Rollback Timeframe
- **Detection**: < 30 seconds (automated monitoring)
- **Execution**: < 60 seconds (pre-warmed containers)
- **Validation**: < 120 seconds (health checks)
- **Total**: < 3.5 minutes end-to-end
