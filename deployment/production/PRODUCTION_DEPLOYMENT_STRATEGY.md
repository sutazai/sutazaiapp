# SutazAI AGI Production Deployment Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive production deployment strategy for the SutazAI AGI system, supporting 84+ AI agents with high availability, scalability, and security.

## Architecture Overview

### System Components
- **Core Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j
- **Vector Stores**: ChromaDB, Qdrant, FAISS
- **AI Inference**: Ollama with multiple models
- **AI Agents**: 84+ specialized agents (AutoGPT, CrewAI, LocalAGI, etc.)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with auto-scaling
- **Security**: Network policies, RBAC, secrets management

## Resource Requirements

### Minimum Production Requirements
- **CPU**: 128 cores (distributed across nodes)
- **Memory**: 512GB RAM total
- **Storage**: 10TB SSD (for models and data)
- **Network**: 10Gbps interconnect

### Recommended Production Setup
- **3x Master Nodes**: 16 cores, 64GB RAM each
- **10x Worker Nodes**: 32 cores, 128GB RAM each
- **3x GPU Nodes**: 32 cores, 256GB RAM, 4x A100 GPUs each

## High Availability Strategy

### Multi-Zone Deployment
- 3 availability zones
- Cross-zone replication
- Automatic failover
- Load balancing across zones

### Data Replication
- PostgreSQL: Streaming replication with 2 replicas
- Redis: Sentinel with 3 nodes
- Neo4j: Causal cluster with 3 cores
- Vector stores: Distributed with 3x replication

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
- CPU-based scaling (70% threshold)
- Memory-based scaling (80% threshold)
- Custom metrics for queue depth

### Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)
- Automatic resource adjustment
- Historical usage analysis
- Predictive scaling

### Cluster Autoscaling
- Node pool scaling based on resource pressure
- Spot instance integration for cost optimization
- Reserved capacity for critical services

## Security Architecture

### Network Security
- Network policies for micro-segmentation
- Service mesh (Istio) for mTLS
- WAF for external endpoints
- DDoS protection

### Access Control
- RBAC with least privilege
- Service accounts for all pods
- External secrets operator
- Audit logging

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance for data handling
- SOC2 controls
- Regular security scans
- Penetration testing

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Custom dashboards per service
- SLI/SLO tracking

### Logging
- Loki for log aggregation
- Structured logging
- Log retention policies
- Real-time alerting

### Tracing
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- Service dependency mapping
- Performance profiling
- Error tracking

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Daily full backups
- Hourly incremental backups
- Cross-region backup replication
- 30-day retention

### Recovery Targets
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 1 hour
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 15 minutes
- Automated recovery procedures
- Regular DR drills

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitOps Workflow
- ArgoCD for deployment
- Git as source of truth
- Automated rollbacks
- Progressive delivery

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests in CI
- Integration tests in staging
- Load testing before production
- Chaos engineering

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Optimization
- Right-sizing based on usage
- Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Reserved instances for baseline
- Automatic cleanup of unused resources

### Monitoring Costs
- Cost allocation tags
- Budget alerts
- Usage reports
- Optimization recommendations
