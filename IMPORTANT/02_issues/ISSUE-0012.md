# ISSUE-0012: Agent Implementation Reality Gap

- **Impacted Components**: All agent services, user expectations, system capabilities
- **Current State**: 1 functional agent (Task Assignment), 7 Flask stubs, 158 documented but unimplemented
- **Metrics**: 0.6% implementation rate of documented agents
- **Options**:
  - A: Implement all 166 agents (6-12 months, unrealistic)
  - B: Implement 10 core agents (2 months, recommended)
  - C: Keep stubs, update docs to match (quick but limits functionality)
- **Recommendation**: B - Implement 10 core agents with real functionality
- **Priority Agents**:
  1. Task Assignment Coordinator (âœ… done)
  2. AI Agent Orchestrator (convert from stub)
  3. Multi-Agent Coordinator (convert from stub)
  4. Resource Arbitration Agent (convert from stub)
  5. Code Review Agent (new)
  6. Documentation Agent (new)
  7. Testing Agent (new)
  8. Deployment Agent (new)
  9. Monitoring Agent (new)
  10. Security Agent (new)
- **Sources**: Agent directory analysis, Flask app.py reviews
