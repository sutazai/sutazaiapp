# ISSUE-0015: Test Coverage Void

**Impacted Components:** All services, CI/CD pipeline, Code quality
**Context:** System has 0% automated test coverage despite production readiness claims. No unit tests, integration tests, or e2e tests exist.

**Options:**
- **A: Pytest + Fixtures for Backend** (Recommended - Phase 1)
  - Pros: Python standard, good async support, fixture reusability
  - Cons: Initial setup effort, test database needed
  
- **B: Full Test Pyramid Implementation**
  - Pros: Comprehensive coverage (unit + integration + e2e)
  - Cons: Large effort, multiple tools needed
  
- **C: Contract Testing Only**
  - Pros: Focus on API boundaries, faster implementation
  - Cons: Misses internal logic bugs, incomplete coverage

**Recommendation:** A initially, then expand to B over time

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Week 1:** Backend unit tests for P0 components (80% target)
2. **Week 2:** API integration tests with test database
3. **Week 3:** Frontend component tests (Streamlit testing)
4. **Week 4:** E2E smoke tests for critical paths

**Consequences:** 
- CI/CD pipeline must run tests before deployment
- Test database fixtures needed
- ~20% development velocity reduction initially
- Long-term quality improvement and faster debugging

**Dependencies:** None (can start immediately)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a code change
When CI pipeline runs
Then unit tests execute with >80% coverage for P0 components

Given a failing test
When pipeline completes
Then deployment is blocked and notifications sent

Given test execution
When results are generated
Then coverage reports are published to monitoring
```

**Test Priority Matrix:**
| Component | Priority | Target Coverage | Test Type |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Auth endpoints | P0 | 95% | Unit + Integration |
| Agent orchestrator | P0 | 90% | Unit + Integration |
| Database operations | P0 | 85% | Unit + Integration |
| API routes | P1 | 80% | Contract + Integration |
| Frontend components | P2 | 70% | Component |
| Monitoring | P3 | 60% | Unit |
