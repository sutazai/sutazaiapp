# ISSUE-0014: Frontend Authentication UI Missing

**Impacted Components:** Frontend (Streamlit), User Experience, Security Layer
**Context:** Backend JWT authentication (ISSUE-0005) requires corresponding frontend UI for login/logout functionality. Current Streamlit app has no authentication interface.

**Options:**
- **A: Streamlit Native Authentication** (Recommended)
  - Pros: Consistent with existing stack, quick implementation via streamlit-authenticator
  - Cons: Limited customization, session management complexity
  
- **B: Separate React Auth Portal**
  - Pros: Full control over UX, industry-standard patterns
  - Cons: Adds new tech stack, split user experience
  
- **C: Basic HTTP Auth** (Temporary)
  - Pros: Immediate solution, zero frontend changes
  - Cons: Poor UX, not suitable for production

**Recommendation:** A - Use streamlit-authenticator library with JWT backend integration

**Consequences:** 
- Requires session state management in Streamlit
- Need to handle token refresh and expiry
- Must coordinate with backend JWT implementation (ISSUE-0005)

**Dependencies:** ISSUE-0005 (Backend JWT implementation)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```gherkin
Given a user accessing the application
When they are not authenticated
Then they see a login form

Given valid credentials submitted
When authentication succeeds
Then user sees main application and JWT token is stored

Given an expired token
When user makes a request
Then they are redirected to login
```
