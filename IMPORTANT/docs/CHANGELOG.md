### Security Hardening (v67.7)
- security(config): Removed hardcoded database/password defaults from backend settings
  - backend/app/core/config.py: POSTGRES_PASSWORD, NEO4J_PASSWORD, GRAFANA_PASSWORD no longer default to insecure values
  - backend/core/config.py: POSTGRES_PASSWORD default removed (empty string; must be provided via env)
  - Added validators to enforce strong passwords in staging/production
- security(pooling): Connection pool now requires `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` from environment
  - backend/app/core/connection_pool.py: eliminated hardcoded fallback secret

[2025-08-09 13:40 UTC] - [v67.7] - [Backend Config] - [Security] - Eliminated hardcoded password fallbacks; env-driven secrets enforced with validators. Agent: Coding Agent (backend specialist). Impact: strengthens secret handling; containers already pass POSTGRES_PASSWORD via compose. Potential dependency: Local runs must set env vars for DB-backed paths.
