# ADR-0005: Canonical Documentation Location and Scope

Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-08-08

Context
- R6 suggests centralizing docs under `/docs/`, while this project mandates `/opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/` as the single source of truth (ASoT).
- R18 requests line-by-line review of `/opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md` and other root docs, while Scope Section 1 limits this operation to `IMPORTANT/`.

Decision
- The ASoT is `IMPORTANT/10_canonical/`. All canonical docs, diagrams, standards, and plans reside here.
- `/docs/` may exist for generated artifacts or public packaging, but it must reference and never diverge from ASoT.
- During this audit, reviews and citations reference only `IMPORTANT/` content to satisfy “single source” and “zero assumptions”. Cross-checks to root files may be performed for validation, but are not authoritative.

Consequences
- Clear ownership and deduplication; no split-brain between `/docs/` and `IMPORTANT/`.
- Any conflict is resolved in favor of ASoT, with an Issue Card and backlog entry when needed.
