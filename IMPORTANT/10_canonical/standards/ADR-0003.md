# ADR-0003: Build Multi-Architecture Container Images

- Context: Heterogeneous environments (amd64 laptops, arm64 servers) and portability requirements
- Decision: Use Docker Buildx to build/push `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` images with registry cache and SBOMs
- Alternatives: Single-arch builds (rejected), emulation-only (slow)
- Consequences: CI complexity increases; wider compatibility; cache needed
- Status: Accepted
- References: CI doc `operations/ci_cd_multiarch.md`
