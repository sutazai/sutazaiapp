Rule 18: Mandatory Documentation Review - Comprehensive Knowledge Acquisition
Requirement: Execute systematic, line-by-line documentation review of all canonical sources before any work begins, ensuring complete contextual understanding, identifying conflicts or gaps, maintaining perfect alignment with organizational standards, architectural decisions, and established procedures, with mandatory CHANGELOG.md creation (project directories only) and maintenance in every directory.
MISSION-CRITICAL: Perfect Knowledge Foundation - Zero Assumptions, Complete Understanding:

Complete Contextual Mastery: Achieve comprehensive understanding of all relevant documentation before making any changes
Universal Change Tracking: Ensure every directory has a current CHANGELOG.md with comprehensive change history
Conflict Detection and Resolution: Identify and resolve any conflicts, outdated information, or gaps in documentation
Architectural Alignment: Ensure all work aligns with established architectural decisions and technical standards
Process Compliance: Validate understanding of all relevant processes, procedures, and quality requirements
Knowledge Validation: Confirm understanding through documented review outcomes and decision rationale
Continuous Synchronization: Maintain ongoing awareness of documentation changes throughout work execution
Team Knowledge Consistency: Ensure all team members have consistent understanding of organizational standards

âœ… Required Practices:
Mandatory CHANGELOG.md creation (project directories only) Requirements:
Universal CHANGELOG.md creation (project directories only) and Maintenance:

Every Directory Must Have CHANGELOG.md: If a CHANGELOG.md doesn't exist in any directory, create one immediately
Comprehensive Change Documentation: Document every change, addition, modification, and deletion with complete context
Real-Time Updates: Update CHANGELOG.md with every modification, never defer change documentation
Standardized Format: Follow established format for consistency across all directories and teams
Historical Preservation: Maintain complete historical record of all changes with precise timestamps
Cross-Directory Integration: Reference related changes in other directories when changes have dependencies
