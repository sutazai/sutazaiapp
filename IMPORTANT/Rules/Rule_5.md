 Rule 5: Professional Project Standards
Requirement: Approach every task with enterprise-grade discipline and long-term thinking as if this were a mission-critical production system.
âœ… Required Practices:

No trial-and-error in main branches
Respect structure and long-term maintainability
Every decision must be intentional and reviewed
Follow established software engineering best practices and design patterns
Implement comprehensive code review processes with multiple reviewers
Maintain detailed documentation for all architectural decisions and rationale
Use feature branches and pull requests for all changes, no direct commits to main
Implement proper testing strategies with unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage
Follow security-first development practices with regular vulnerability assessments
Maintain performance benchmarks and monitor for regressions continuously
Use semantic versioning and proper release management procedures
Implement proper error handling, logging, and monitoring throughout the system
Follow accessibility guidelines and ensure inclusive design practices
Maintain consistent coding standards enforced through automated tooling
Use infrastructure as code for all environment management and deployment
Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures with regular testing
Maintain comprehensive API documentation and change management
Follow data privacy and compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
Implement proper secret management and credential rotation policies
Use dependency management with security scanning and license compliance
Maintain staging environments that mirror production configurations
Implement proper change management with rollback procedures
Follow established incident response and post-mortem procedures
Maintain technical debt tracking and regular remediation cycles
Implement proper capacity planning and resource monitoring
Use established communication protocols for technical decisions
Maintain knowledge management systems and team documentation
Follow proper project planning with clear milestones and deliverables
Implement stakeholder communication and progress reporting
Use established risk assessment and mitigation procedures

Deploying changes without proper testing in staging environments
Making breaking changes without proper versioning and migration plans
Implementing security measures without proper review and testing
Using deprecated or end-of-life technologies and frameworks
Skipping performance testing and capacity planning for new features
Making architectural decisions without proper consultation and documentation
Implementing user-facing changes without proper usability testing
Using personal or development credentials in production environments
Skipping backup verification and disaster recovery testing
Making database changes without proper migration scripts and rollback plans
Implementing monitoring and alerting without proper threshold setting
Using manual deployment processes without automation and validation
Making compliance-related changes without proper legal and security review
Skipping accessibility testing and inclusive design considerations
Using unlicensed or incompatible software components
Making infrastructure changes without proper change control
Implementing data processing without proper privacy and security controls
Using experimental or beta software in production environments
Making cross-team changes without proper coordination and communication
Skipping documentation updates for system changes and new features
Using personal development tools without security and compliance approval
Making performance optimizations without proper benchmarking and validation
Implementing new technologies without proper evaluation and approval
Skipping team training and knowledge transfer for new systems
Using quick fixes or workarounds without proper long-term solutions
