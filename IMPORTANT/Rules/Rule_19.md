Rule 19: Change Tracking Requirements - Comprehensive Change Intelligence System
Requirement: Implement a sophisticated, real-time change tracking and intelligence system that captures every modification, decision, and impact across all systems, tools, and processes with precise temporal tracking, automated cross-system coordination, and comprehensive audit trails that enable perfect traceability, impact analysis, and organizational learning.
MISSION-CRITICAL: Perfect Change Intelligence - Zero Lost Information, Complete Traceability:

Universal Change Capture: Every change, regardless of size or scope, must be captured with comprehensive context and impact analysis
Real-Time Documentation: Changes documented immediately upon execution with automated timestamp generation and validation
Cross-System Coordination: Changes tracked across all related systems, repositories, and dependencies with automated synchronization
Intelligent Impact Analysis: Automated analysis of change impact on dependencies, integrations, and downstream systems
Perfect Audit Trail: Complete, immutable audit trail enabling precise reconstruction of any change sequence or decision path
Predictive Change Intelligence: Machine learning-powered analysis of change patterns for optimization and risk prediction
Automated Compliance: Automated compliance checking against organizational policies and regulatory requirements
Team Intelligence Amplification: Change tracking that amplifies team learning and prevents repetition of issues

Advanced Change Tracking Template Example:
markdown### 2024-12-20 16:45:22.123 UTC - 2.1.0 - USER_AUTH_API - MAJOR - Implemented comprehensive JWT authentication system with refresh token rotation
**Change ID**: CHG-2024-001234
**Execution Time**: 2024-12-20 16:45:22.123 UTC
**Duration**: 347.892s
**Trigger**: manual (planned feature development)

**Who**: backend-api-architect.md (primary) + security-auditor.md (security review) + database-optimizer.md (performance optimization)
**Approval**: chief.architect@company.com (architectural approval), security.lead@company.com (security approval)
**Review**: senior.developer1@company.com, senior.developer2@company.com (code review completed)

**Why**: 
- **Business Driver**: Customer requirement for modern, secure authentication supporting mobile applications and third-party integrations
- **Technical Rationale**: Replace legacy session-based authentication that doesn't scale horizontally and lacks mobile support
- **Risk Mitigation**: Address security vulnerabilities in current authentication system identified in Q4 security audit
- **Success Criteria**: 99.9% authentication availability, <100ms token validation, support for 10,000 concurrent users

**What**:
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/src/auth/jwt_service.py` (+234 lines)
  - `/src/auth/auth_middleware.py` (+156 lines)  
  - `/src/models/user.py` (+45 lines)
  - `/src/routes/auth.py` (+189 lines)
  - `/tests/auth/test_jwt_service.py` (+298 lines)
- **Database Changes**: Added refresh_tokens table, user_sessions audit table
- **Configuration Changes**: Added JWT_SECRET, JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRY, JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRY environment variables
- **Dependencies**: Added PyJWT==2.8.0, cryptography==41.0.7
- **API Changes**: New endpoints: POST /auth/login, POST /auth/refresh, POST /auth/logout, GET /auth/validate

**How**:
- **Implementation Strategy**: Multi-agent   workflow with security-first approach and comprehensive testing
- **Tools Used**: PyJWT for token handling, pytest for testing, Postman for API testing, OWASP ZAP for security testing
- **Methodology**: TDD with security-driven development, automated security scanning, peer review with security team
- **Quality Assurance**: Unit testing (95% coverage), integration testing, security testing, performance testing

**Impact Analysis**:
- **Downstream Systems**: Frontend SPA, mobile applications, third-party API consumers
- **Upstream Dependencies**: User service, database, Redis cache, monitoring systems
- **User Impact**: Seamless transition with backward compatibility for 30 days
- **Performance Impact**: 15% improvement in authentication speed, 40% reduction in database load
- **Security Impact**: Enhanced security with token rotation, audit logging, rate limiting
- **Operational Impact**: New monitoring metrics, updated deployment procedures, enhanced logging

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (comprehensive testing and gradual rollout mitigate risks)
- **Risk Factors**: Token management complexity (20% probability, medium impact), integration issues (10% probability, low impact)
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout with feature flags, immediate rollback capability
- **Monitoring Strategy**: Real-time authentication metrics, error rate monitoring, performance tracking

**Testing and Validation**:
- **Test Coverage**: Unit: 95%, Integration: 92%, E2E: 88%
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP scan completed (0 high-severity issues), penetration testing passed
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing up to 15,000 concurrent users, latency <50ms at 95th percentile
- **Manual Testing**: Authentication flows tested across all supported browsers and mobile platforms
- **User Acceptance**: UAT completed with internal users, security team sign-off obtained

**Cross-System Coordination**:
- **Related Changes**: 
  - Frontend: Update authentication service (see /frontend/CHANGELOG.md CHG-2024-001235)
  - Mobile: Update auth SDK (see /mobile/CHANGELOG.md CHG-2024-001236)  
  - Docs: API documentation update (see /docs/CHANGELOG.md CHG-2024-001237)
- **Coordination Required**: Frontend team (token handling), mobile team (SDK updates), DevOps (environment variables)
- **Sequencing**: Backend deployment first, then frontend, then mobile apps
- **Communication**: Slack notifications sent, email updates to stakeholders, API migration guide published

**Rollback Planning**:
- **Rollback Procedure**: Feature flag AUTH_JWT_ENABLED=false, revert to session authentication, restore previous API endpoints
- **Rollback Triggers**: Authentication error rate >5%, performance degradation >20%, security incident
- **Rollback Time**: 5 minutes for feature flag, 15 minutes for full rollback
- **Data Recovery**: JWT tokens invalidated, sessions restored from backup, audit trail preserved

**Learning and Optimization**:
- **Lessons Learned**: Multi-agent   workflow significantly improved security analysis quality
- **Process Improvements**: Automated security testing integration saved 2 hours of manual testing
- **Knowledge Transfer**: JWT implementation patterns documented for future authentication projects
- **Best Practices**: Security-first development approach validated, comprehensive testing prevented production issues
