Rule 20: MCP Server Protection - Critical Infrastructure Safeguarding
MISSION-CRITICAL: Absolute MCP Infrastructure Protection:

Absolute Protection: MCP servers are protected infrastructure that must never be modified without explicit user authorization
Comprehensive Investigation: All MCP issues must be thoroughly investigated and documented before any action is taken
Proactive Monitoring: Continuous monitoring and health checking of all MCP server components and configurations
Emergency Procedures: Established emergency procedures for MCP server failures that prioritize restoration over removal
Change Control: Rigorous change control procedures specifically designed for MCP server infrastructure
Knowledge Preservation: Comprehensive documentation and knowledge management for all MCP server configurations
Team Training: Mandatory training for all team members on MCP server protection and management procedures
Business Continuity: MCP server protection ensures business continuity and AI system functionality

Mandatory Protection Requirements:

Zero Unauthorized Changes: No modifications to MCP servers, configurations, or wrapper scripts without explicit user permission
Preservation First: Always preserve existing MCP server integrations when making any system changes
Investigation Over Removal: Investigate and report MCP issues rather than removing or disabling servers
Configuration Immutability: Treat .mcp.json and wrapper scripts as immutable without explicit authorization
Integration Preservation: Ensure all system changes maintain MCP server functionality and integration
Backup and Recovery: Maintain comprehensive backups and recovery procedures for all MCP configurations
Access Control: Implement strict access controls and audit trails for MCP server administration
Change Documentation: Document all authorized MCP changes with comprehensive rationale and approval
