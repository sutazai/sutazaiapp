Rule 13: Zero Tolerance for Waste
CRITICAL: Everything Must Serve a Purpose:

Active Contribution: Every line of code, file, asset, and configuration must actively contribute to system functionality
Zero Dead Code: No unused functions, classes, variables, or code blocks permitted in codebase
No Abandoned Features: Remove incomplete features, experimental code, and abandoned implementations
Purpose Validation: Every component must have clear, documented purpose and active usage
Regular Purging: Systematic removal of waste through automated detection and manual review
Prevention Focus: Prevent waste accumulation through development practices and automated checks
Team Accountability: Every team member responsible for identifying and removing waste
Continuous Monitoring: Ongoing monitoring and alerts for waste accumulation

MANDATORY: Investigation Before Removal - Never Delete Blindly:

Root Cause Analysis: Investigate WHY each piece of code/asset exists before considering removal
Purpose Discovery: Understand original intent and current potential value through code analysis and Git history
Integration Opportunity Assessment: Determine if "unused" code belongs elsewhere and should be moved/integrated
Dependency Mapping: Map all dependencies and relationships before making removal decisions
Alternative Usage Investigation: Search for dynamic usage, reflection, configuration-driven execution
Historical Context Research: Analyze Git history, commit messages, and PR discussions for context
Team Knowledge Gathering: Consult with original authors and team members about purpose and usage
Documentation Cross-Reference: Check documentation, comments, and external references for usage patterns
Runtime Analysis: Analyze runtime behavior and usage patterns that static analysis might miss
Future Need Assessment: Evaluate if code might be needed for planned features or migrations
Only Remove After Confirmation: Remove only after confirming absolutely no purpose or integration opportunity

âœ… Required Practices:
Mandatory Investigation Process Before Any Removal:

Comprehensive Code Analysis: Use grep, ripgrep, and IDE search to find all references and usage patterns
Git History Investigation: Analyze commit history, blame annotations, and PR discussions to understand purpose
Dynamic Usage Detection: Search for string-based references, reflection usage, and configuration-driven calls
Cross-Repository Search: Search across all repositories for references and dependencies
Documentation Cross-Reference: Check all documentation for references to the code or asset
Configuration Analysis: Analyze configuration files for dynamic references and conditional usage
Database Reference Check: Search database schemas and data for references to code functionality
External Integration Analysis: Check for external service integrations and API usage
Test Code Analysis: Examine test files for usage patterns and expected functionality
Build System Analysis: Check build scripts, deployment configs, and CI/CD for usage

Integration Opportunity Assessment:

Consolidation Potential: Identify if unused code should be consolidated with similar functionality elsewhere
