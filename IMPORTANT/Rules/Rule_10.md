Rule 10: Functionality-First Cleanup - Never Delete Blindly
âœ… Required Practices:
Investigation and Analysis Phase:

Search for all references and dependencies across the entire codebase, documentation, and configuration
Understand purpose and current usage through code analysis, Git history, and stakeholder consultation
Test system functionality without it in isolated environments before production removal
Archive before deletion if uncertain with detailed metadata and restoration procedures
Document what was removed and why with comprehensive impact analysis and decision rationale
Perform recursive dependency analysis to identify indirect dependencies and usage patterns
Review Git commit history to understand original implementation intent and evolution
Analyze code metrics and usage statistics to determine actual utilization patterns
Interview original developers or maintainers when possible for historical context
Review bug reports and incident logs for any references to the target functionality
Check external documentation, wikis, and knowledge bases for usage references
Analyze API logs and monitoring data for actual runtime usage patterns
Review configuration files and environment variables for hidden dependencies
Check deployment scripts and infrastructure code for usage references
Analyze database schemas and data migrations for structural dependencies
Review test suites for both direct and indirect test coverage
Check continuous integration pipelines for build and deployment dependencies
Analyze monitoring and alerting configurations for observability dependencies
Review backup and recovery procedures for data and configuration dependencies
Check compliance and audit requirements for retention and functionality needs

Risk Assessment and Safety Measures:

Categorize cleanup impact as low, medium, or high risk based on comprehensive analysis
Identify all stakeholders who might be affected by the removal
Assess potential business impact and user experience degradation
Evaluate security implications of removing security-related functionality

Run automated test suites to catch any regression in existing functionality
Test rollback procedures to ensure rapid restoration capability if needed
Validate monitoring and alerting systems continue to function properly
Test configuration management and deployment procedures
Perform data integrity validation for any database or storage changes
Execute cross-platform and cross-browser testing for user interface changes

Documentation and Communication Requirements:

Create detailed removal plans with step-by-step procedures and timelines
Document all discovered dependencies and their resolution or migration strategies
Record decision rationale including risk assessment and mitigation strategies
Update architectural documentation to reflect system changes
Revise user documentation and help guides to remove references
Update API documentation and change logs for external consumers
Communicate planned removals to all affected teams and stakeholders
Create migration guides for users or systems dependent on removed functionality
Document rollback procedures with exact restoration steps and time estimates
Update monitoring and alerting documentation for any observability changes
Revise troubleshooting guides and runbooks to reflect system changes
Create post-removal validation checklists and acceptance criteria
Document lessons learned and improve cleanup procedures for future use
Update team knowledge bases and training materials
Record cleanup metrics and timelines for process improvement

Code and Logic Cleanup:

Analyze function and method usage through static code analysis tools
Use runtime profiling to identify actually executed code paths
Review code coverage reports to identify untested and potentially unused code
Analyze import dependencies and module usage patterns
Check for dynamic code execution that might not be caught by static analysis
Review reflection and metaprogramming usage that might create hidden dependencies
Validate that interfaces and abstract classes are not implemented elsewhere
