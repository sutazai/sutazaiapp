## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document establishes the mandatory engineering standards for the SutazAI system. These standards are designed to ensure code quality, system reliability, maintainability, and professional excellence. Compliance is not optional—it is a fundamental requirement for all contributors.

The standards herein have been developed based on industry best practices, lessons learned from system evolution, and the specific requirements of our distributed AI architecture. They represent the minimum acceptable level of engineering discipline required for this project.
