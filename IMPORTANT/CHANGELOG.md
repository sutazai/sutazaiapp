## August 6, 2025 - Major Documentation Accuracy Update

### Overview
Complete documentation overhaul to reflect actual system state as verified through direct container inspection and endpoint testing. Removed all fantasy elements, corrected service counts, and documented actual capabilities.

### System Reality Summary
- **Containers Running:** 28 (not 59 as previously documented)
- **Agent Services:** 7 Flask stubs (not 69 intelligent agents)
- **Model Loaded:** TinyLlama 637MB (not gpt-oss)
- **Database Tables:** 14 created and functional
- **Backend Status:** HEALTHY with Ollama connected

### Key Changes Made Across All Documents

1. **Service Count Corrections**
   - Before: "59 services deployed"
   - After: "28 containers running"

2. **Agent Reality**
   - Before: "69 intelligent AI agents with complex orchestration"
   - After: "7 Flask stub services returning hardcoded JSON"

3. **Model Accuracy**
   - Before: "gpt-oss model deployed"
   - After: "TinyLlama 637MB loaded"

4. **Database Status**
   - Before: "Database initialized" (vague)
   - After: "14 tables created and functional in PostgreSQL"

5. **Fantasy Features Removed**
   - Quantum computing modules
   - AGI/ASI orchestration
   - Complex inter-agent communication
   - Self-improvement capabilities
   - Advanced ML pipelines

6. **Added Reality Checks**
   - Actual curl commands that work
   - Real port mappings verified
   - Container status from docker ps
   - Endpoint responses documented

### Verification Method
All changes based on:
- Direct container inspection: `docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Status}}"`
- Endpoint testing: `curl http://127.0.0.1:[port]/health`
- Database verification: `docker exec -it sutazai-postgres psql -U sutazai -d sutazai -c '\dt'`
- Log analysis: `docker-compose logs [service]`

### Impact
These documentation updates provide developers with:
- Accurate system understanding
- Realistic expectations
- Working commands
- Clear distinction between working features and stubs
- Honest assessment of capabilities

### Next Documentation Tasks
- [ ] Continue monitoring for drift between docs and reality
- [ ] Update as new features are actually implemented
- [ ] Remove any remaining fantasy elements discovered
- [ ] Add integration guides for connecting stub services
