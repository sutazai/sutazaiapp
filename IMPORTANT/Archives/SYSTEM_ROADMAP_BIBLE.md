## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### System Reality (As of August 6, 2025 23:18 UTC)

**What Actually Exists:**
- 28 containers running (verified via `docker ps`)
- PostgreSQL with 14 tables CREATED (agents, tasks, users, etc.)
- Backend API v17.0.0 reporting "healthy" with Ollama connected
- TinyLlama model (637MB) loaded and operational
- 7 Flask agent services returning stub responses
- Full monitoring stack operational (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- Redis cache and Neo4j graph database functional

**Critical Misalignments:**
- Agents have NO ACTUAL LOGIC (return hardcoded JSON)
- 31 services defined in docker-compose but NOT running
- Kong API Gateway has NO routes configured
- Vector databases running but NOT integrated
- 75+ requirements files creating dependency chaos
- ChromaDB experiencing connection issues

### Vision Statement

Transform the current stub infrastructure into a functional, production-grade AI agent orchestration platform that delivers measurable business value through intelligent task automation and multi-agent collaboration.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Current State | 30 Day Target | 90 Day Target | 180 Day Target |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Functional Agents | 0/7 | 1/7 | 7/7 | 7/7 + 3 new |
| Real AI Processing | 0% | 25% | 75% | 100% |
| Agent Communication | None | Basic | Advanced | Production |
| System Uptime | Unknown | 95% | 99% | 99.9% |
| Response Time | N/A | <2s | <1s | <500ms |
| Concurrent Users | 0 | 10 | 100 | 1000 |

**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** BLOCKER - Nothing else proceeds until complete  

### Objective
Resolve all blocking issues preventing basic system functionality.

### User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

#### STORY 0.1: Fix Model Configuration Alignment
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** the backend to use the correct LLM model

## TECHNICAL DEBT MANAGEMENT

### Current Technical Debt Inventory

| Item | Priority | Effort | Impact | Target Phase |
|------|----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| 75+ requirements files | CRITICAL | 2 days | High | Phase 0 |
| Stub agent implementations | CRITICAL | 14 days | High | Phase 1-2 |
| Missing authentication | HIGH | 5 days | High | Phase 3 |
| No automated tests | HIGH | 10 days | Medium | Phase 1-3 |
| Inconsistent error handling | MEDIUM | 5 days | Medium | Phase 2 |
