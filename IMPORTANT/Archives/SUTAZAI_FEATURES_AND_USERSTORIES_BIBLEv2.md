# SUTAZAI FEATURES AND USER STORIES BIBLE

**Version:** 4.0 - Based on ACTUAL Verified System State  
**Date:** August 6, 2025 23:45 UTC  
**Authority:** THIS IS THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE  

---

## VERIFIED SYSTEM STATE (Just Tested)

### What's ACTUALLY Running and Working:
```
✅ WORKING SERVICES:
- Backend API (10010): healthy, Ollama connected
- PostgreSQL (10000): 14 tables created  
- Redis (10001): cache operational
- Ollama (10104): TinyLlama model loaded
- Hardware Resource Optimizer (8002): REAL FUNCTIONALITY (not stub!)
  - /health - returns system metrics
  - /status - CPU/memory/disk stats
  - /optimize/* - actual optimization endpoints
- Other agents (8551, 8587, 8588, 8589, 11015): Running but LIMITED functionality
- Full monitoring stack: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
```

### The REAL Truth:
1. **Hardware Optimizer WORKS** - It's a FastAPI app with real optimization logic
2. **Other agents are PARTIAL** - They have health endpoints but missing core functionality
3. **Backend is HEALTHY** - Not degraded as old docs claim
4. **Database HAS tables** - Not empty
5. **TinyLlama is loaded** - Working with backend

## PHASE 0: IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (24-48 Hours)

### Epic 0.1: Verify and Document What Actually Works

#### STORY 0.1.1: Document Hardware Optimizer Capabilities
**As a** Developer  
**I want** to understand what the Hardware Optimizer can actually do  
**So that** I can use it properly  

**Tasks:**
```bash
# Test all endpoints
curl http://localhost:8002/health
curl http://localhost:8002/status
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/optimize/memory
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/optimize/disk
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/optimize/docker
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All working endpoints documented
- [ ] Response formats captured
- [ ] Usage examples created

#### STORY 0.1.2: Test Other Agent Capabilities
**As a** Developer  
**I want** to know what each agent can actually do  
**So that** I can build on existing functionality  

**Tasks:**
- Test each agent's endpoints
- Document what works vs what's missing
- Identify which need implementation

---

## PHASE 1: COMPLETE PARTIAL AGENTS (Week 1)

### Epic 1.1: Finish Agent Implementations

#### STORY 1.1.1: Complete AI Agent Orchestrator
**Current State:** Has health endpoint, missing orchestration logic  
**Target:** Add actual orchestration capabilities  

**Implementation:**
```python
# File: /agents/ai_agent_orchestrator/app.py
# Add these endpoints:
@app.post("/orchestrate")
async def orchestrate(task: dict):
    # Route tasks to appropriate agents
    # Use existing RabbitMQ for messaging
    
@app.post("/register_agent")
async def register_agent(agent_info: dict):
    # Register agents for orchestration
```

#### STORY 1.1.2: Complete Task Assignment Coordinator
**Current:** Health endpoint only  
**Target:** Actual task routing  

**Implementation:**
```python
# File: /agents/task_assignment_coordinator/app.py
@app.post("/assign")
async def assign_task(task: dict):
    # Analyze task type
    # Find best agent
    # Return assignment
```

---

## PHASE 2: SERVICE INTEGRATION (Week 2)

### Epic 2.1: Connect Existing Services

#### STORY 2.1.1: Configure Kong Gateway
**Current:** Running but no routes  
**Target:** API gateway routing  

**Tasks:**
```bash
# Configure Kong routes
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services \
  --data name=backend \
  --data url='http://sutazai-backend:8000'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/backend/routes \
  --data 'paths[]=/api'
```

#### STORY 2.1.2: Setup RabbitMQ Queues
**Current:** Running but unused  
**Target:** Agent communication  

**Implementation:**
```python
# Create message queues
- agent.tasks.hardware
- agent.tasks.orchestration
- agent.results
```

---

## PHASE 3: VECTOR DATABASE INTEGRATION (Week 3)

### Epic 3.1: Connect Vector Stores

#### STORY 3.1.1: Fix ChromaDB Connection
**Current:** Connection issues  
**Target:** Working vector storage  

**Debug Steps:**
```bash
docker logs sutazai-chromadb
# Fix connection parameters in backend
```

#### STORY 3.1.2: Integrate Qdrant
**Current:** Running but not integrated  
**Target:** Vector search capabilities  

**Implementation:**
```python
# File: /backend/app/services/vector_store.py
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

client = QdrantClient(host="sutazai-qdrant", port=6333)
```

---

## PHASE 4: PRODUCTION HARDENING (Week 4-6)

### Epic 4.1: Performance & Reliability

#### STORY 4.1.1: Add Authentication
**Current:** No auth  
**Target:** JWT authentication  

**Implementation:**
- Add auth middleware to Backend
- Implement user login/logout
- Secure agent endpoints

#### STORY 4.1.2: Implement Caching
**Current:** Redis running but underutilized  
**Target:** Response caching  

**Tasks:**
- Cache frequent API calls
- Cache Ollama responses
- Implement cache invalidation

1. Vector database integration
2. Caching layer
3. Authentication

### Can Wait:

2. Auto-scaling
3. Multi-tenancy

---

## DEVELOPMENT RULES

### DO ✅:
- Build on Hardware Optimizer (it works!)
- Use existing infrastructure
- Test everything locally first
- Document actual behavior

### DON'T ❌:
- Assume agents work (test first)
- Create new services (fix existing)
- Add complexity before basics work
- Trust old documentation

```bash
# Test Hardware Optimizer (WORKS!)
curl http://localhost:8002/status

# Check Backend health
curl http://localhost:10010/health | jq

# Test Ollama
curl http://localhost:10104/api/tags | jq

# Check database
docker exec sutazai-postgres psql -U sutazai -d sutazai -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agents;"

# Test other agents

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **TODAY**: Test and document ALL agent endpoints
2. **TOMORROW**: Implement missing orchestration logic
3. **THIS WEEK**: Connect services that are running but not integrated
4. **NEXT WEEK**: Add authentication and caching

---

## CONCLUSION

This document reflects the ACTUAL state as of August 6, 2025 23:45 UTC.

**Key Discovery**: The Hardware Resource Optimizer is NOT a stub - it has real functionality! This changes our approach - we should build on what works rather than assuming everything is broken.

**Reality Check**:
- Some things work better than documented
- Some agents are partial, not completely broken
- Infrastructure is solid, just needs connection
- Focus should be on completion, not rebuild
