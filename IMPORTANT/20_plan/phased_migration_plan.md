3. [ ] Document actual running services in README
4. [ ] Disable non-functional agent containers

### Exit Criteria
- Backend connects to correct model
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Documentation reflects reality

### Rollback
- Git revert if config breaks
- Previous docker images tagged

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Security (Days 2-5)
**Owner**: Backend Architect
**Goal**: Secure the system

### Tasks
1. [ ] Create UUID migration scripts
2. [ ] Apply database schema with UUID PKs
3. [ ] Implement JWT authentication service
4. [ ] Add authentication middleware to all endpoints
5. [ ] Create user registration/login endpoints
6. [ ] Add basic input validation

### Exit Criteria
- All tables use UUID primary keys
- User can register and login
- All endpoints require authentication (except /health)
- SQL injection prevented

### Checkpoint
- Security review by System Architect
- Penetration testing of auth endpoints

### Rollback
- Database backup before migration
- Feature flag for auth (can disable)

## Phase 2: Agent Reality (Days 6-15)
**Owner**: Backend Architect + System Architect
**Goal**: Real agents doing real work

### Tasks
1. [ ] Define standard agent message protocol
2. [ ] Convert AI Orchestrator from stub to functional
3. [ ] Convert Multi-Agent Coordinator from stub
4. [ ] Implement Code Assistant agent
5. [ ] Implement Documentation Assistant agent
6. [ ] Create inter-agent communication system
7. [ ] Add agent health monitoring

### Exit Criteria
- 5 agents with actual functionality
- Agents can communicate via RabbitMQ
- Task distribution working
- Real results returned (not stubs)

### Checkpoint
- Demo of agent collaboration
- Performance benchmarks
- Error rate < 5%

### Rollback
- Keep stub versions available
- Feature flags per agent

---

## Phase 3: Integration Layer (Days 16-25)
**Owner**: System Architect
**Goal**: Connect all services

### Tasks
1. [ ] Integrate ChromaDB with backend
2. [ ] Create document upload API
3. [ ] Implement embedding generation
4. [ ] Configure Kong API routes
5. [ ] Setup rate limiting
6. [ ] Implement circuit breakers
7. [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

### Exit Criteria
- Documents uploadable and searchable
- API Gateway routing traffic
- Rate limits enforced
- Graceful error handling

### Checkpoint
- Integration tests passing
- Load testing (100 concurrent users)
- Vector search accuracy > 80%

### Rollback
- Direct service access bypass (skip Kong)
- Disable vector search (fallback to keyword)

---

## Phase 4: Observability (Days 26-30)
**Owner**: System Architect
**Goal**: Know what's happening

### Tasks
1. [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for agents
2. [ ] Implement distributed tracing
3. [ ] Setup log aggregation rules
4. [ ] Configure alerts for failures
5. [ ] Create runbooks for common issues
6. [ ] Implement SLI/SLO tracking

### Exit Criteria
- All agent metrics visible
- Alerts fire for failures
- Logs searchable in Loki
- Performance baselines established

### Checkpoint
- Observability review
- Alert testing (induced failures)
- Dashboard usability review

---

## Phase 5: Quality & Testing (Days 31-35)
**Owner**: Backend Architect
**Goal**: Ensure reliability

### Tasks
1. [ ] Write integration tests (80% coverage)
2. [ ] Create performance test suite
3. [ ] Document API endpoints
4. [ ] Security testing
5. [ ] Create deployment automation
6. [ ] Update all documentation

### Exit Criteria
- Test coverage > 80%
- Performance tests automated
- API documentation complete
- Security scan passing

### Checkpoint
- Code review by all architects
- Test coverage report
- Performance test results

---

## Phase 6: Production Readiness (Days 36-42)
**Owner**: All Architects
**Goal**: Ready for users

### Tasks
1. [ ] Create backup/restore procedures
2. [ ] Document disaster recovery
3. [ ] Setup staging environment
4. [ ] Create user documentation
5. [ ] Performance optimization
6. [ ] Final security audit

### Exit Criteria
- Backup/restore tested
- Staging environment matches prod
- User guide complete
- Performance meets SLOs
- Security audit passed

### Final Checkpoint
- Go/No-Go meeting with stakeholders
- Load test with 100 users
- Full system demo

## Risk Management

### High Risks
1. **Model limitations**: tinyllama may be insufficient
   - Mitigation: Design for model swapping
   - Contingency: Upgrade to larger model

2. **Timeline aggressive**: 6 weeks for major refactor
   - Mitigation: Focus on MVP features only
   - Contingency: Extend by 2 weeks if needed

3. **Authentication complexity**: Never implemented before
   - Mitigation: Use proven libraries (FastAPI-JWT)
   - Contingency: Hire security consultant

### Medium Risks
1. **Agent communication**: Complex distributed system
   - Mitigation: Start simple (direct calls)
   - Contingency: Single orchestrator pattern

2. **Performance issues**: Unknown bottlenecks
   - Mitigation: Early performance testing
   - Contingency: Horizontal scaling

### Rollback Strategy
- Each phase independently deployable
- Git tags at each phase completion
- Database backups before migrations
- Feature flags for new functionality
- Previous versions kept as Docker tags
- Runbooks for reverting each phase

## Success Metrics

### Phase Success Indicators
- Phase 0: Model connection working
- Phase 1: Users can authenticate
- Phase 2: Agents return real results
- Phase 3: Documents searchable
- Phase 4: Metrics visible
- Phase 5: Tests passing
- Phase 6: Production deployed

### Overall Success (Week 6)
- [ ] 100 concurrent users supported
- [ ] < 2 second response time (p95)
- [ ] 5 functional agents
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Documents searchable
- [ ] 99% uptime
- [ ] No critical security issues
- [ ] Documentation current

## Communication Plan
- Daily standup (15 min)
- Weekly architecture review
- Phase completion demos
- Stakeholder updates at checkpoints
- Risk reviews weekly
