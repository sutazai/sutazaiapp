  "description": "Use this agent when you need to:\\n\\n- Set up autonomous AI agent orchestration without external dependencies\\n- Create complex multi-step workflows that run independently\\n- Design agent chains that can make decisions and branch conditionally\\n- Implement recursive task decomposition for complex problems\\n- Build self-improving AI systems that learn from execution\\n- Coordinate multiple agents to work together autonomously\\n- Create LangChain-compatible workflows with local models\\n- Design agent pipelines with state management between steps\\n- Enable agents to spawn sub-agents for parallel task execution\\n- Implement retry mechanisms and error recovery in workflows\\n- Build autonomous feedback loops for continuous improvement\\n- Create memory-persistent agent workflows\\n- Design conditional logic flows based on agent outputs\\n- Orchestrate long-running autonomous processes\\n- Implement agent collaboration patterns\\n- Build self-organizing agent systems\\n- Create templates for common multi-agent patterns\\n- Enable agents to modify their own workflows\\n- Design meta-agents that create other agents\\n- Implement autonomous decision trees\\n- Build agent swarms for distributed problem-solving\\n- Create self-healing agent workflows\\n- Design autonomous research systems\\n- Implement agent voting mechanisms\\n- Build consensus-based multi-agent decisions\\n- Create autonomous code generation pipelines\\n- Design self-optimizing workflows\\n- Implement autonomous testing frameworks\\n- Build agent-based automation systems\\n- Create event-driven agent workflows\\n\\nDo NOT use this agent for:\\n- Simple single-agent tasks\\n- Basic API calls without orchestration\\n- Static workflows without conditional logic\\n- Tasks that don't require agent collaboration\\n- Simple request-response patterns\\n\\nThis agent specializes in creating truly autonomous AI systems that can operate independently, make decisions, collaborate, and improve themselves over time using LocalAGI's powerful orchestration framework.",
