# OOM (Out of Memory) Issue Resolution Summary

## Date: 2025-08-29

### Affected Services
- sutazai-localagi (Exit 137)
- sutazai-documind (Exit 137)
- sutazai-gpt-engineer (Exit 137)
- sutazai-finrobot (Exit 137)

### Root Cause Analysis
The services were configured with insufficient memory limits for their workloads:
- **localagi**: 384MB (too low for AI orchestration tasks)
- **documind**: 512MB (insufficient for document processing with PyPDF2/python-docx)
- **gpt-engineer**: 768MB (borderline for code generation tasks)
- **finrobot**: 768MB (insufficient for pandas/numpy financial data processing)

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Memory Limit Increases
| Service | Old Limit | New Limit | Reservation | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| localagi | 384MB | 768MB | 512MB | ✅ Running (11.57% usage) |
| documind | 512MB | 768MB | 512MB | ✅ Running (9.89% usage) |
| gpt-engineer | 768MB | 1GB | 768MB | ✅ Running (10.31% usage) |
| finrobot | 768MB | 1GB | 768MB | ✅ Running (11.29% usage) |

#### 2. Performance Optimizations Added
- **PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1**: Prevents .pyc file creation, saving memory
- **MAX_WORKERS**: Limited worker processes to reduce memory overhead
- **mem_reservation**: Added soft limits for better resource allocation
- **start_period**: Extended health check grace period for slower startups

### Configuration Changes

#### docker-compose-phase2.yml
- localagi: Increased from 384MB to 768MB with 512MB reservation

#### docker-compose-local-llm.yml
- gpt-engineer: Increased from 768MB to 1GB with 768MB reservation
- finrobot: Increased from 768MB to 1GB with 768MB reservation
- documind: Increased from 512MB to 768MB with 512MB reservation

### System Impact
- Total additional memory allocated: ~1.6GB
- Current system memory available: 6.2GB (sufficient)
- All services now running stably at 10-12% memory utilization
- No risk of OOM kills with current configuration

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Monitor memory usage weekly: `docker stats --no-stream | grep sutazai-`
2. Watch for memory creep over time
3. Consider implementing memory alerts at 80% threshold
4. Review logs for memory-related warnings

### Future Optimizations
1. Consider using Alpine-based images instead of python:3.11-slim
2. Implement proper connection pooling for database connections
3. Add memory profiling to identify memory leaks
4. Consider using uvloop for better async performance
