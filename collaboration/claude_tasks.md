## 📝 Notes for Gemini

### Areas Requiring Collaboration
1. **API Design**: Need frontend perspective on endpoint structure
2. **Error Messages**: Need user-friendly error message suggestions
3. **Performance Metrics**: Need to align on user-facing performance targets
4. **Feature Priorities**: Need input on which features users value most

### Handoff Points
1. After API optimization → Frontend integration testing
2. After security implementation → UI security features
3. After monitoring setup → Dashboard design
4. After documentation → User guide creation
