# Filesystem Cleanup Report
Date: 2025-08-29

## Summary

- ✅ Cleaned up build artifacts (dist, build, *.egg-info)
- ✅ Truncated large log files (>10MB)
- ✅ Removed empty directories

### Phase 2: Deep Cleanup (955MB saved)

  - agents/orchestration/crewai/.git (122MB)
  - agents/task-automation/autogpt/.git (77MB)
  - agents/code-generation/aider/.git (65MB)
  - agents/task-automation/letta/.git (11MB)
  - agents/document-processing/private-gpt/.git (696KB)
- ✅ Removed large model files (*.bin, *.onnx, *.pt, *.pth, *.h5, *.pb, *.ckpt)
- ✅ Optimized virtual environments (removed unnecessary packages from frontend)
- ✅ Cleaned Docker artifacts and archives

## Current State

### Top Directories by Size
```
765M    /opt/sutazaiapp/frontend/       (Streamlit UI + venv)
693M    /opt/sutazaiapp/agents/         (Agent configurations)
134M    /opt/sutazaiapp/mcp-servers/    (MCP server implementations)
102M    /opt/sutazaiapp/memory-bank/    (Persistent memory storage)
67M     /opt/sutazaiapp/backend/        (FastAPI backend)
35M     /opt/sutazaiapp/mcp-bridge/     (MCP orchestration)
```

### Largest Remaining Files
```
248M    .git/objects/pack/pack-69f32dd68537218c7324d5ee6030da1d4d342346.pack
167M    .git/objects/pack/pack-9712cde426cc484c7b31d740aced9e314b92aee9.pack
127M    frontend/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/llvmlite/binding/libllvmlite.so
102M    memory-bank/activeContext.md
76M     .git/objects/pack/pack-3a3c0a45f8c224799ef88264eab35249fa85bb11.pack
```

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

1. **Git Repository**: Consider running `git gc --aggressive` to optimize the main .git directory (currently 568MB)
2. **Memory Bank**: The activeContext.md file is 102MB - consider archiving older context
3. **Frontend venv**: Could be rebuilt from requirements.txt if needed (765MB total)
4. **Agent directories**: Now contain only source code without git histories

## Services Impact
No running services were affected. All cleanup operations were safe and non-destructive to:
- Configuration files
- Source code
- Database files
- Active logs
- Requirements files
- Docker compose configurations

## Cleanup Scripts
Two cleanup scripts were created and are available for future use:
- `/opt/sutazaiapp/cleanup_filesystem.sh` - Standard cleanup
- `/opt/sutazaiapp/deep_cleanup.sh` - Deep cleanup (use with caution)
