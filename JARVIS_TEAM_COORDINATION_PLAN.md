4. **User First** - If it doesn't work for users, it doesn't work
5. **Document Everything** - Code without docs doesn't exist

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Voice dependencies fail to install
```bash
docker exec sutazai-backend apt-get update
docker exec sutazai-backend apt-get install -y portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
docker exec sutazai-backend pip install SpeechRecognition whisper vosk pyttsx3 pygame
```

**Issue:** WebSocket connection refused
```python
# Check if WebSocket endpoint is registered
# In app/api/v1/router.py ensure:
from fastapi import WebSocket
@router.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
```

**Issue:** Ollama not responding
```bash
docker restart sutazai-ollama
docker exec sutazai-ollama ollama pull tinyllama:latest
```

**Issue:** Frontend can't connect to backend
```javascript
// Check CORS settings in backend
// Ensure frontend uses correct backend URL: http://localhost:10200
```
