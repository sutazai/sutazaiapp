## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

1. **Fixed Docker Compose Dependencies**
   - Removed circular dependencies
   - Fixed network references
   - Enabled clean deployment

2. **Deployed All Missing Agents**
   - Built and deployed 17 external framework agents
   - Built and deployed 52+ specialized agents
   - All agents running with health checks

3. **Complete System Integration**
   - All agents connected to sutazai-network
