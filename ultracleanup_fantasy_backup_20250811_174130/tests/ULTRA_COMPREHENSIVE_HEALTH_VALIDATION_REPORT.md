## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### üö® PRIMARY ISSUE: Secondary Service AI Dependency Failure

**Issue:** Jarvis Hardware Resource Optimizer experiencing Ollama connection failures
**Impact:** Service reports unhealthy status and cannot perform AI-powered optimizations
**Root Cause:** Connection pool exhaustion to Ollama service
**Severity:** HIGH (Service functional but degraded)

**Error Pattern:**
```
2025-08-10 08:20:22,238 - agents.core.ollama_pool - ERROR - Health check failed: No connections available and at max capacity
2025-08-10 08:20:22,263 - agents.core.ollama_pool - ERROR - Failed to create connection: Connection test failed: All connection attempts failed
```

**Recommendation:** Implement connection pool management and retry logic for Ollama integration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SECONDARY ISSUE: High Concurrency Timeout

**Issue:** Secondary service cannot handle high concurrent load (50 concurrent requests)
**Impact:** 0% success rate under high concurrency with 10-second timeouts
**Root Cause:** AI processing latency combined with synchronous request handling
**Severity:** MEDIUM (Affects scalability)

**Recommendation:** Implement asynchronous processing and request queuing for AI operations

### üí° MINOR ISSUE: CPU Metrics Variance

**Issue:** Primary service CPU reporting shows 12% variance from actual system metrics
**Impact:** Monitoring accuracy slightly reduced
