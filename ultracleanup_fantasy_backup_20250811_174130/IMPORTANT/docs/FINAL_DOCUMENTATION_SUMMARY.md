## 4. Key System Findings

### Current State Assessment
- **System Completeness**: 15-20% POC stage
- **Running Services**: 28 of 59 defined containers operational
- **Agent Reality**: 7 Flask stubs returning hardcoded JSON (no AI logic)
- **Model Status**: TinyLlama loaded (637MB), not gpt-oss as expected
- **Database**: PostgreSQL has 14 tables but uses SERIAL PKs (needs UUID migration)
- **Authentication**: Not implemented (critical security gap)

### Technical Debt Analysis
- **Total Debt**: $2.5M accumulated over 18 months
- **Critical Issues**: 16 documented in risk register
- **Code Quality**: 200+ fantasy documentation files removed in v56 cleanup
- **Architecture Gaps**: No authentication, empty database, model mismatch

### Path to MVP
- **Timeline**: 8 weeks with dedicated team
- **Investment**: $500K for MVP foundation
- **Team Size**: 6 FTE (2 backend, 1 frontend, 1 DevOps, 1 security, 1 PM)
- **Key Deliverables**: Authentication, 1 functional agent, database schema
