## Security Remediation Implementation

### 1. Secure Container Images

#### Backend Service (`backend/Dockerfile.secure`)
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for minimal attack surface
FROM python:3.12.8-slim AS builder
# Build dependencies and application

FROM python:3.12.8-slim AS runtime
# Security: Create non-root user
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser -d /app -s /sbin/nologin appuser

# Security: Minimal runtime with security updates
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get clean

# Security: Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Security: Health check and exec form CMD
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 CMD [health-check]
CMD ["python", "-m", "uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

#### Frontend Service (`frontend/Dockerfile.secure`)
```dockerfile
# Similar multi-stage approach with Streamlit-specific security
FROM python:3.12.8-slim AS builder
# Build stage

FROM python:3.12.8-slim AS runtime
# Security hardening for frontend
USER appuser
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port", "8501", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0"]
```

### 2. Security-Hardened Docker Compose (`docker-compose.secure.yml`)

#### Security Context Implementation
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true      # Prevent privilege escalation
      - apparmor:unconfined        # Enable AppArmor protection
    cap_drop:
      - ALL                        # Drop all Linux capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE          # Only allow network binding
    read_only: true               # Read-only root filesystem
    user: "1000:1000"            # Non-root user
```

#### Resource Limits
```yaml
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '4'
          memory: 4G
          pids: 1000              # Prevent fork bombs
        reservations:
          cpus: '1'
          memory: 1G
```

#### Network Security
```yaml
networks:
  sutazai-network:
    driver: bridge
    driver_opts:
      com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc: "false"  # Disable inter-container communication
      com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade: "true"
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16   # Custom subnet for isolation
```
