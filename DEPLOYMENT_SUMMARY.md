- **State Persistence**: JSON-based state tracking with resume capability
- **Deployment History**: Complete audit trail of all deployment operations
- **Recovery Options**: Multiple rollback strategies and recovery mechanisms

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- Production deployment requires secure token validation
- Role-based access control for different deployment targets
- Secure secret generation and storage

### Network Security
- Isolated Docker networks for service communication
- Automatic firewall configuration for production deployments
- SSL/TLS encryption for all external communications

### Data Protection
- Encrypted secret storage
- Secure file permissions and access controls
- Backup encryption and integrity verification

## üìä Quality Assurance

### Testing & Validation
- **Pre-flight Checks**: System requirements and dependency validation
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive service health monitoring
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality verification
- **Performance Tests**: Resource usage and performance validation

### Error Handling

- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing
- **User Feedback**: Clear progress reporting and error messages

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Simple Local Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh
# or
./deploy.sh deploy local
```

### Production Deployment with Full Safety
```bash
export PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_TOKEN="your_secure_64_char_token"
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```
