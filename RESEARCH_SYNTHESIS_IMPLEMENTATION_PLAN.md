## CONCLUSION

This synthesis reveals a clear path from the current vulnerable stub system to a functional, research-backed AI agent platform. The key insights are:

1. **CPU-only deployment is viable** but requires careful optimization and realistic expectations
2. **Current system must be secured** before any development proceeds
3. **Phased implementation** dramatically increases success probability
4. **Proven technologies** (CrewAI, Ollama, Docker Compose) provide solid foundation
5. **Resource constraints** are manageable with proper monitoring and limits

The transformation will require significant work to replace stub implementations with functional code, but the research provides clear guidance on architecture patterns, performance targets, and scaling strategies that work in real production environments.

**Next Step:** Begin Phase 1 security remediation immediately - no development should proceed until the 715 critical vulnerabilities are addressed.
