# Integration Sign-off (Architect)

Date: 2025-08-08
Phase: 3–4 (Integration, Validation)

Scope:
- Execute health checks, tests, lint/type checks, and security scans
- Record outcomes as JSONL per schema

Environment Notes:
- Local environment missing required tooling (docker, curl, pytest, black, flake8, mypy, bandit)
- All steps instrumented via `scripts/run_integration.py` with graceful failure capture

Artifacts:
- Integration results: `reports/cleanup/integration_results.jsonl`
- Conflict/dependency reports: `reports/cleanup/conflict_map.json`, `reports/cleanup/dependency_graph.json`
- Security (if available): `reports/cleanup/bandit.json`

Instructions to Reproduce on a Fully Provisioned Host:
1) `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d`
2) `python3 scripts/run_integration.py`
3) Review `reports/cleanup/integration_results.jsonl` and confirm all suites passed

Sign-off Gate (Pass/Fail):
- This host: FAIL due to missing tooling (environmental)
- Code readiness: READY — centralizations applied; tests/scans wired for execution

Architect Approval: PENDING execution on provisioned CI/runner
