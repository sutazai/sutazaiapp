# CLN-20250808-AGENT-METRICS-CENTRALIZATION

Change Type: Deduplication and centralization
Date: 2025-08-08
Author: System Architect

Summary:
- Consolidated duplicated Prometheus metrics implementations across agent packages to a single canonical module.
- Canonical source: `agents/core/metrics.py`.
- Replaced the following modules with lightweight compatibility shims that re-export from the canonical module:
  - `agents/ai_agent_orchestrator/metrics.py`
  - `agents/coordinator/metrics.py`
  - `agents/resource_arbitration_agent/metrics.py`
  - `agents/ollama_integration/metrics.py`
  - `agents/hardware-resource-optimizer/metrics.py`
  - `agents/task_assignment_coordinator/metrics.py`

Rationale:
- Removes multiple copies of identical classes/functions (`AgentMetrics`, `MetricsTimer`, `setup_metrics_endpoint`).
- Ensures consistent behavior and easier maintenance across agents.

Outcome:
- `reports/cleanup/conflict_map.json` duplicate groups reduced (66 → 62 → 46).

Compatibility:
- Import paths remain stable; modules still exist and export the same names.

Traceability:
- Task ID: CLN-20250808-AGENT-METRICS-CENTRALIZATION

Validation Plan:
- Static analysis re-run to confirm duplicate reduction.
- Agent processes should import metrics from their original paths without code changes.
