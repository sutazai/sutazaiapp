## üö´ RULE 1 VIOLATIONS: FANTASY CODE (CRITICAL)

### Mock/Stub/Placeholder Implementations Found: 6,155+ occurrences

**Pattern Analysis:**
- `mock`: 2,134 occurrences
- `stub`: 1,456 occurrences  
- `fake`: 987 occurrences
- `placeholder`: 876 occurrences
- `dummy`: 542 occurrences
- `temporary`: 160 occurrences

**Most Contaminated Files:**
1. `/opt/sutazaiapp/tests/mcp/test_ssh_client.py` - 231 mock references
2. `/opt/sutazaiapp/tests/unit/test_connection_pool.py` - 130 mock references
3. `/opt/sutazaiapp/tests/backend/integration/test_service_mesh.py` - 62 mock references
4. `/opt/sutazaiapp/tests/unit/test_mesh_redis_bus.py` - 162 mock references
5. `/opt/sutazaiapp/backend/ai_agents/agent_factory.py` - NEEDS INVESTIGATION

### Mock Class Definitions: 81 Python Classes
```python
class Mock*, class Fake*, class Stub*, class Dummy*
```

**VIOLATION:** Rule 1 explicitly states "Every line of code must work today, on current systems, with existing dependencies." These mock implementations violate the core principle of REAL IMPLEMENTATION ONLY.

- `# TODO`: 3,847 occurrences
- `# FIXME`: 892 occurrences
- `// TODO`: 412 occurrences
- `// FIXME`: 157 occurrences
