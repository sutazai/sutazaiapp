# Playwright E2E Test Skeleton

Canonical testDir: `./tests/e2e`

Conventions
- File names: `*.spec.ts`
- BaseURL, projects, and timeouts are configured in `playwright.config.ts`.
- Keep tests colocated under `tests/e2e` (do not duplicate under `docs/`).

Note: This directory contains no tests yet; it serves as the canonical target for new E2E tests after route discovery and API contract validation.
