# 🚨 EMERGENCY RESPONSE SUMMARY
## System Overload Resolution

---

## 📊 Initial Crisis
- **CPU Usage**: 77.6% 
- **Load Average**: 20.32 on 12-core system
- **Critical Containers**: 10+ containers using 40-50% CPU each
- **Memory**: 36.2% (10.6GB/29.4GB)

---

## 🛑 Actions Taken

### 1. Emergency Stabilization
- Stopped all high-CPU containers (>40% usage)
- Stopped all containers in restart loops
- Applied CPU limits to remaining containers

### 2. Aggressive Reduction
- Stopped ALL 46 agent containers
- Kept only infrastructure running:
  - PostgreSQL (CPU limit: 1.0)
  - Redis (CPU limit: 0.5)
  - Neo4j (CPU limit: 1.0)
  - Ollama (CPU limit: 2.0)
  - Backend (CPU limit: 1.0)
  - ChromaDB
  - Qdrant

### 3. Prevented Restarts
- Updated restart policies to 'no' for problematic containers
- Especially bigagi-system-manager (was using 120 restarts)

---

## 📁 Scripts Created

```bash
# Emergency stabilization
/opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/emergency-system-stabilization.sh

# Aggressive CPU reduction
/opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/aggressive-cpu-reduction.sh

# Phased restart (when ready)
/opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/phased-system-restart.sh
```

---

## ✅ Current Status
- **Running Containers**: 8 (infrastructure only)
- **Expected CPU**: <20%
- **Expected Load**: <4.0 (after 3-5 minutes)

---

## 🔧 Recovery Plan

### Phase 1: Stabilization (NOW)
1. Wait 5 minutes for load to drop
2. Monitor: `watch uptime`
3. Verify CPU: `docker stats --no-stream`

### Phase 2: Core Services (When load <6.0)
```bash
./scripts/phased-system-restart.sh
```
This will start:
- Core infrastructure (if not running)
- Backend services
- Critical agents only

### Phase 3: Gradual Recovery (When stable)
1. Start performance agents (5 at a time)
2. Wait 5 minutes between batches
3. Monitor CPU after each batch
4. Stop if CPU >50% or load >8.0

### Phase 4: Full Recovery
- Start specialized agents last
- Apply all fixes from CRITICAL_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
- Implement proper health checks

---

## ⚠️ Root Causes Identified

1. **No CPU limits** on agent containers
2. **Failed health checks** causing restart loops
3. **Too many agents** starting simultaneously
4. **Ollama overload** (was at 185% CPU)
5. **No phased startup** strategy

---

## 🎯 Permanent Solutions

1. **Enforce CPU/Memory limits** (completed)
2. **Fix health checks** (curl installed)
3. **Implement phased startup** (script ready)
4. **Ollama optimization** (config ready)
5. **Monitoring deployment** (pending)

## 📞 If System Crashes Again

```bash
# Nuclear option - stop everything
docker stop $(docker ps -q)

# Start only essentials
docker start sutazai-postgres sutazai-redis
docker start sutazai-ollama
docker start sutazai-backend

# Then follow phased restart
```
