**Date:** 2025-08-05  
**System:** SutazAI Multi-Agent System  
**Analysis Period:** Last 1 hour  
**Analyst:** Runtime Behavior Anomaly Detection Specialist

## Executive Summary

Critical runtime anomalies detected affecting 60+ AI agents (67% failure rate), infrastructure services, and overall system performance. The system is experiencing:

1. **Mass Agent Failures**: 60+ agents exiting with code 127 (command not found)
2. **Infrastructure Service Gaps**: Core services (Consul, Kong, RabbitMQ) not deployed
3. **Resource Saturation**: High CPU usage (74.5%), excessive process spawning
4. **Dependency Chain Failures**: Missing dependencies causing cascading failures
5. **Backend Service Instability**: Repeated restarts with missing module errors

**Immediate Actions Required**: Fix agent container configurations, deploy missing infrastructure services, and resolve dependency issues.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Agent Exit Code 127 Anomaly

**Description**: 60+ AI agents are failing to start with exit code 127, indicating "command not found" errors.

**Evidence**:
- Exit pattern: `Exited (127) X minutes ago`
- Affected agents include: ai-agent-orchestrator, system-architect, deployment-automation-master, etc.
- Container entrypoint: `sh -c pip install ... && python /app/main.py`

**Timeline**: Started approximately 40 minutes ago, continuing to present

**Impact**: 
- Severity: **CRITICAL**
- 67% of agents non-functional
- Core orchestration and automation capabilities offline
- System operating at 33% capacity

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
1. Missing `/app/main.py` file in container images
2. Incorrect working directory configuration
3. Base image lacking required Python installation
4. Volume mounting issues preventing access to application code

### 2. Infrastructure Service Build Failures

**Description**: Critical infrastructure services (Consul, Kong, RabbitMQ) defined in `docker-compose.infrastructure.yml` are not running.

**Evidence**:
- Services defined but not deployed
- No active containers for consul, kong, or rabbitmq
- Infrastructure compose file exists but not integrated with main deployment

**Timeline**: Services never started in current deployment

**Impact**:
- Severity: **HIGH**
- No service discovery (Consul)
- No API gateway (Kong)
- No message queue (RabbitMQ)
- Agent communication severely limited

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
- Infrastructure services not included in deployment workflow
- Separate compose file not being executed
- Missing orchestration to bring up infrastructure before agents

### 3. Performance Bottlenecks

**Description**: System experiencing high CPU usage and process spawning storms.

**Evidence**:
```
- CPU Usage: 74.5% (very high)
- Load Average: 15.75, 17.61, 27.63 (extremely high for 12 cores)
- Multiple Python processes consuming 50-66% CPU each
- Excessive pip installation processes running simultaneously
```

**Timeline**: Ongoing, intensifying over the last hour

**Impact**:
- Severity: **HIGH**
- System responsiveness degraded
- Resource contention between services
- Potential for system instability

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
- Agents repeatedly attempting to install dependencies on every restart
- No dependency caching mechanism
- Restart loops causing CPU thrashing
- Missing resource limits on containers

### 4. Service Dependency Chain Failures

**Description**: Cascading failures due to missing dependencies and modules.

**Evidence**:
- Backend warnings: Missing modules (aiohttp, prometheus_client, nmap)
- Multiple router setup failures
- Repeated restart cycles (backend restarted 20+ times)
- File watcher triggering unnecessary reloads

**Timeline**: Continuous over observation period

**Impact**:
- Severity: **HIGH**
- Backend API functionality limited
- Monitoring capabilities offline
- Chat and orchestration features unavailable

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
- Incomplete dependency specification in backend requirements
- Development mode file watching causing instability
- Missing production configuration
- Circular dependency issues

### 5. Resource Utilization Anomalies

**Description**: Abnormal resource consumption patterns indicating inefficient operations.

**Evidence**:
- Memory: 12.5GB used, 16GB available (healthy)
- Disk: 219GB used of 1TB (healthy)
- Process count: 382 total, 19 running (high)
- Zombie processes: 6 (concerning)

**Timeline**: Building over the last 2 hours

**Impact**:
- Severity: **MEDIUM**
- Process table pollution
- Potential memory leaks from zombie processes
- Inefficient resource utilization

## Risk Assessment

### Severity Ratings

1. **Agent Failures (Exit 127)**: CRITICAL - System operating at 33% capacity
2. **Missing Infrastructure**: HIGH - No service mesh or message queue
3. **Backend Instability**: HIGH - Core API repeatedly failing
4. **Performance Degradation**: HIGH - System under severe load
5. **Resource Inefficiency**: MEDIUM - Suboptimal but manageable

### Potential Consequences

- **Immediate**: System unable to process workloads effectively
- **Short-term**: Complete system failure if load continues to increase
- **Long-term**: Data inconsistency, lost work, reputation damage

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-4 hours)

1. **Fix Agent Container Images**
   ```bash
   # Verify main.py exists in agent images
   docker run --rm sutazai-ai-agent-orchestrator:latest ls -la /app/
   
   # Update Dockerfiles to ensure proper app structure
   # Add WORKDIR /app to all agent Dockerfiles
   ```

2. **Deploy Infrastructure Services**
   ```bash
   # Bring up infrastructure services first
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.infrastructure.yml up -d
   
   # Wait for health checks
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.infrastructure.yml ps
   ```

3. **Stop Resource Thrashing**
   ```bash
   # Stop all failing agents to reduce load
   docker stop $(docker ps -a | grep "Exited (127)" | awk '{print $1}')
   
   # Remove stopped containers
   docker container prune -f
   ```

4. **Fix Backend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Update backend requirements.txt
   echo "aiohttp>=3.8.0" >> backend/requirements.txt
   echo "prometheus-client>=0.16.0" >> backend/requirements.txt
   echo "python-nmap>=0.7.1" >> backend/requirements.txt
   
   # Rebuild backend
   docker-compose build backend
   ```

### Short-term Improvements (4-24 hours)

1. **Implement Dependency Caching**
   - Use multi-stage Docker builds
