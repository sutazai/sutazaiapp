# CHANGELOG

This folder maintains a local CHANGELOG for quick, path-scoped updates. For the authoritative, cross-repo log, use `/docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

Conventions:
- Follow Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, refactor, chore, test).
- Keep entries concise and scoped to this folder.
- Include date, author/agent, and impact.

Template entry:
- [TIME UTC - YYYY-MM-DD] - [version or N/A] - [component] - [change type] - [description]
