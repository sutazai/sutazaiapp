# SutazAI Dependency Management Guide

## Overview


## Key Principles

3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential packages are included.

## Dependency Management Tools

### 1. Safety
- Integrated into our dependency management workflow
- Configured to block updates with critical vulnerabilities

### 2. Pipdeptree
- Validates dependency tree for conflicts
- Ensures no package version incompatibilities

## Dependency Update Strategy

- **Critical**: Monthly updates, automatic patching
- **High**: Quarterly updates, manual review required
- **Medium**: Semi-annual updates, optional

### Update Process
1. Run vulnerability scan
2. Check for outdated packages
3. Validate dependency tree
5. Run comprehensive test suite

## Configuration Files

### `requirements.txt`
- Pinned package versions
- Grouped by functionality
- SHA256 hash comments for verification

### `dependency_policy.yml`
- Defines update frequencies
- Configures compliance checks

## Best Practices

1. Never commit `requirements.txt.lock`
2. Use virtual environments
3. Regularly audit dependencies
4. Prefer minimal, well-maintained packages

## Automated Workflows

### Dependency Validation Script
- Located at `utils/dependency_manager.py`
- Performs comprehensive dependency checks
- Logs all actions and findings


- Block packages from unverified sources
- Require package signature verification
- Scan for maintainer reputation
- Validate entire dependency tree

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Version conflicts
- Outdated packages

### Resolution Steps
1. Check `dependency_manager.log`
2. Run `pipdeptree` for conflict details
3. Use `safety check` for vulnerability info

## Contributing

When adding new dependencies:
1. Justify the package's necessity
3. Verify minimal version requirements
4. Update documentation

## Monitoring and Alerts

- Email notifications for critical vulnerabilities
- System log tracking of all dependency changes
- Performance impact monitoring

## Future Improvements

- Machine learning-based dependency recommendation
- Enhanced compliance reporting
