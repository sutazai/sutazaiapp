## Usage Instructions

### To use an agent in Claude:

```
You: I need help setting up a secure document processing system

Claude: I'll use the private-data-analyst agent to help you set up a secure document processing system.

<Uses Task tool with subagent_type="private-data-analyst">
```

### To validate agent configurations:

```bash
python3 /opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/validate_agent_configs.py
```

### To view the agent health dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run /opt/sutazaiapp/frontend/agent_health_dashboard.py
```

## Next Steps
