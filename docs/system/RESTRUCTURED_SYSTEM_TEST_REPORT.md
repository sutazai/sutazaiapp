3. **External Dependencies**: Some advanced features may require additional services

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Production Ready)
1. ✅ **Deploy Current System**: All tests pass, system is production-ready
2. ✅ **Monitor Resources**: Current usage well within safe limits
3. ✅ **Scale as Needed**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling

### Future Enhancements
