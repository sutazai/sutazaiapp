## Quality Metrics

### Coverage Requirements

| Component | Minimum Coverage | Target Coverage |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| Backend | 90% | 95% |
| Agents | 85% | 90% |
| Scripts | 70% | 80% |
| Overall | 85% | 95% |

### Security Thresholds

| Severity | Threshold | Action |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Critical | 0 | Block deployment |
| High | ‚â§ 5 | Review required |
| Medium | ‚â§ 20 | Warning issued |
| Low | No limit | Monitor |

### Performance Standards

| Metric | Threshold | Measurement |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Test Execution | < 10 minutes | Full test suite |
| API Response | < 100ms | Standard endpoints |
| Memory Usage | < 2GB | Peak during tests |
| File Size | < 5MB | Individual files |

### Quality Score Calculation

```
Quality Score = 100 - (
  Critical Issues √ó 10 +
  High Issues √ó 5 +
  Medium Issues √ó 2 +
  Vulnerabilities √ó 3 +

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Pre-commit Hooks Failing

**Symptoms:**
- Commit blocked by pre-commit
- Hook execution errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Update hooks
make pre-commit-update

# Run manually to debug
make pre-commit-run

# Skip specific hook (emergency only)
SKIP=hook-name git commit -m "message"
```

#### 2. Coverage Below Threshold

**Symptoms:**
- Coverage validation fails
- Tests pass but coverage insufficient

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Generate coverage report
make coverage-report

# Identify uncovered code
open tests/reports/coverage/html/index.html

# Add tests for uncovered areas
# Re-run validation
make coverage
```

#### 3. Security Scan Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Security gates fail
- Critical vulnerabilities detected

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Run detailed security scan
make security-comprehensive

# Review security report
cat tests/reports/security/security_summary_*.md

# Update vulnerable dependencies
pip install --upgrade package-name

# Re-run security validation
make quality-gates-security
```

#### 4. Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Quality gates timeout
- Slow test execution

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Run performance analysis
make performance-gates

# Check large files
find . -size +10M -not -path "./.git/*"

# Optimize test execution
pytest tests/unit/ -n auto  # parallel execution
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Bypass Quality Gates (Use Sparingly)

```bash
# Skip pre-commit hooks (logged)
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix: [justification]"

# Force deployment despite failures
# Set force_deployment: true in workflow_dispatch
```

#### Rollback Quality Gate Changes

```bash
# Restore previous pre-commit config
git checkout HEAD~1 .pre-commit-config.yaml

# Disable specific workflow
# Comment out workflow file temporarily
```
