# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policies for the SutazAI project. It provides guidelines and best practices to ensure the security and integrity of our systems.

## Overview

Our security policy is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data processed by SutazAI. The policy addresses potential security threats and outlines required preventive and corrective measures.

## Security Guidelines

- Ensure that all dependencies are kept up-to-date with security patches.
- Use continuous integration tools to run static code analysis (e.g., [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)).
- Maintain regular integrity checks on critical system files.
- Enforce secure coding practices and guidelines.
- Perform regular vulnerability scans.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue, please contact our security team immediately.

## Acknowledgements

We acknowledge the contribution of Cristian, Suta, and the broader community in developing security best practices.

## 1. Access Control

### 1.1 Root User Management

- **Primary Root User**: Florin Cristian Suta
- Contact:
  - Email: <chrissuta01@gmail.com>
  - Phone: +48517716005

### 1.2 Authentication Mechanism

- **Primary Authentication**: OTP-Based Net Access Control
- No permanent JWT tokens
- Manual approval required for external network access

## 2. Network Access Protocol

### 2.1 Default Network State

- System runs with no external calls by default
- Explicit OTP approval required for network usage

### 2.2 OTP Verification Process

1. Network access attempt triggered
2. OTP generated and sent to root user
3. Manual verification required
4. Temporary, limited network access granted
5. Automatic network access revocation after use

## 3. Logging and Monitoring

### 3.1 Comprehensive Logging

- All network calls logged in `online_calls.log`
- Detailed error and access tracking
- Immutable log records

### 3.2 Monitoring Endpoints

- Continuous system health monitoring
- Automated anomaly detection
- Real-time alert mechanisms

## 4. Agent Security

### 4.1 Supreme AI Constraints

- Non-root orchestrator
- Limited system modification permissions
- Strict action validation

### 4.2 Sub-Agent Isolation

- Containerized agent environments
- Restricted resource access
- Mandatory permission checks

## 5. Dependency Management

### 5.1 Dependency Scanning

- Regular security vulnerability checks
- Pinned, vetted dependency versions
- Automated dependency updates

### 5.2 Code Integrity

- Semgrep security scanning
- Regular code review processes
- Automated security validation

## 6. Incident Response

### 6.1 Error Handling

- Comprehensive error logging
- Self-healing mechanisms
- Automatic error report generation

### 6.2 Fallback Mechanisms

- Manual repository synchronization scripts
- Automatic rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive system recovery protocols

## 7. Compliance and Best Practices

- Principle of Least Privilege
- Zero Trust Architecture
- Continuous Security Enhancement

## 8. Future Security Roadmap

- Advanced Cryptographic Key Management
- Enhanced Biometric Authentication
- AI-Driven Threat Detection
