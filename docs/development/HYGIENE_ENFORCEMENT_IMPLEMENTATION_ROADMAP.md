- [ ] Create `scripts/hooks/hygiene-pre-push.sh`
- [ ] Create `scripts/hooks/hygiene-post-merge.sh`
- [ ] Add installation script for hooks

### 3.2 CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/hygiene-enforcement.yml`
- [ ] Add Jenkins pipeline configuration
- [ ] Set up GitLab CI integration (if applicable)
- [ ] Configure build failure thresholds

## Phase 4: Monitoring & Reporting (Week 6)

### 4.1 Monitoring Dashboard
- [ ] Set up FastAPI backend at `monitoring/dashboard/backend/`
- [ ] Create React frontend at `monitoring/dashboard/frontend/`
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Add metrics collection endpoints
- [ ] Create visualization components

### 4.2 Reporting System
- [ ] Implement daily report generator
- [ ] Create weekly summary generator
- [ ] Set up monthly executive reports
- [ ] Configure notification channels (Slack, email)

## Phase 5: Agent Implementation (Week 7-8)

### 5.1 Specialized Agents
Create Python implementations for each agent in `.claude/agents/`:

- [ ] `garbage-collector.py` - Junk file removal
- [ ] `deploy-automation-master.py` - Deployment consolidation
- [ ] `multi-agent-coordinator.py` - Agent orchestration
- [ ] `container-orchestrator-k3s.py` - Docker optimization
- [ ] `senior-backend-developer.py` - Code quality
- [ ] `mega-code-auditor.py` - Comprehensive analysis
- [ ] `system-optimizer-reorganizer.py` - Structure optimization
- [ ] `document-knowledge-manager.py` - Documentation management

### 5.2 Agent Communication
- [ ] Implement agent registry service
- [ ] Create inter-agent communication protocol
- [ ] Add agent health monitoring
- [ ] Set up agent resource limits

## Phase 6: Async Framework (Week 9)

### 6.1 Non-Blocking Execution
- [ ] Implement async file I/O handlers
- [ ] Create parallel rule checking system
- [ ] Add progressive result streaming
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Set up graceful degradation

### 6.2 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add connection pooling for Redis
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add batch processing for large operations

## Phase 7: Safety & Rollback (Week 10)

### 7.1 Safety Mechanisms
- [ ] Implement snapshot system before changes
- [ ] Create rollback functionality
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Implement resource protection
- [ ] Create emergency stop mechanism

### 7.2 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for each enforcement module
- [ ] Integration tests for orchestration
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Chaos engineering tests
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Phase 8: Deployment & Documentation (Week 11-12)

### 8.1 Deployment Automation
- [ ] Create Docker images for all components
- [ ] Set up Kubernetes manifests

- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Agent development guide
- [ ] Operations manual
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Architecture decision records

## Monitoring & Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
1. **Enforcement Coverage**: % of rules actively enforced
2. **Violation Detection Rate**: Violations found per scan
3. **Fix Success Rate**: % of violations automatically fixed
4. **System Performance**: Average enforcement time per rule
5. **Resource Efficiency**: CPU/Memory usage per enforcement

### Operational Metrics
- Mean time to detect violations (MTTD)
- Mean time to remediate (MTTR)
- False positive rate
- Agent success rate
- System availability

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **System Overload**: Implement circuit breakers and rate limiting
2. **False Positives**: Add review mechanism before auto-fixes
3. **Breaking Changes**: Mandatory rollback capability
4. **Agent Failures**: Fallback to manual enforcement

### Operational Risks
1. **Team Resistance**: Gradual rollout with feedback loops
2. **Performance Impact**: Resource monitoring and limits
3. **Integration Conflicts**: Extensive testing in staging
4. **Documentation Drift**: Automated doc validation

## Maintenance Plan

### Daily Tasks
- Monitor system health dashboards
- Review enforcement reports
- Address critical violations
- Check agent performance

### Weekly Tasks
- Analyze trend reports
- Update rule configurations
- Review false positives
- Optimize performance bottlenecks

### Monthly Tasks
- Full system audit
- Update agent capabilities
- Review and update documentation
- Plan feature enhancements

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Set up development environment
   - Install infrastructure components
   - Create initial configuration files

2. **Week 1 Goals**:
   - Complete Phase 1 foundation setup
   - Start implementing critical rule modules
   - Set up basic monitoring

3. **First Month Target**:
   - Have critical rules (13, 12, 10, 2, 9) fully operational
   - Basic monitoring dashboard functional
   - Git hooks integrated and tested
