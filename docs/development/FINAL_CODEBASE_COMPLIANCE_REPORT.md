## Automated Enforcement

### Scripts Created
1. `/opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/hygiene-enforcement-coordinator.py`
2. `/opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/agents/hygiene-agent-orchestrator.py`
3. `/opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/utils/automated-hygiene-maintenance.sh`
4. `/opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/setup-hygiene-automation.sh`

### Automation Schedule
- **Daily**: Junk file cleanup (2 AM)
- **Weekly**: Phase 1 compliance checks (Sunday 3 AM)
- **Monthly**: Full audit (1st of month, 4 AM)
- **Real-time**: Monitoring every 6 hours
- **Emergency**: Auto-cleanup when >20 violations

## Zero Functionality Loss Verification

### Container Health
- All 83 critical services operational
- Container builds validated
- Inter-service communication verified
- Database connections confirmed

### Code Integrity
