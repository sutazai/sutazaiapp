## 🔒 Security Posture Assessment

### Before Hardening (Risk Level: 🔴 HIGH)
- ❌ Exposed secrets in configuration files
- ❌ Weak container security
- ❌ Missing security headers
- ❌ No intrusion detection
- ❌ Inadequate access controls

### After Hardening (Risk Level: 🟡 MEDIUM)
- ✅ Secrets properly encrypted and secured
- ✅ Container hardening with security contexts
- ✅ Comprehensive security headers implemented
- ✅ Active intrusion detection system
- ✅ Enhanced access controls and monitoring

## 📊 Network Security Analysis

### Network Exposure Summary
- **Total External Ports:** 45 services exposed
- **Database Services Exposed:** Redis (10001)
- **Administrative Interfaces:** Multiple agent services (10000-12000 range)
- **Critical Services:** Properly secured with authentication

### Security Recommendations Generated
1. **Firewall Rules:** `/opt/sutazaiapp/firewall-rules.txt`
2. **Network Segmentation:** `/opt/sutazaiapp/docker-compose.network-secure.yml`
3. **Service Isolation:** Backend/Frontend network separation guide
