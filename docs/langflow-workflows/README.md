## Agent Workflow Overview

SutazAI operates 69 specialized agents organized into functional categories:

### Development Agents (20 agents)
- **Core Development**: senior-frontend-developer, senior-backend-developer, senior-full-stack-developer
- **AI Specialists**: senior-ai-engineer, deep-learning-brain-architect, deep-learning-brain-manager
- **Code Quality**: code-generation-improver, code-quality-gateway-sonarqube, mega-code-auditor
- **Testing**: testing-qa-validator, ai-qa-team-lead, ai-testing-qa-validator

### Infrastructure & DevOps (15 agents)
- **Container Management**: container-orchestrator-k3s, container-vulnerability-scanner-trivy
- **Deployment**: deployment-automation-master, infrastructure-devops-manager
- **Monitoring**: observability-dashboard-manager-grafana, metrics-collector-prometheus
- **Security**: kali-security-specialist, security-pentesting-specialist

### AI/ML Operations (12 agents)
- **Model Management**: ollama-integration-specialist, neural-architecture-search
- **Training**: evolution-strategy-trainer, genetic-algorithm-tuner
- **Analysis**: data-drift-detector, quantum-ai-researcher

### Management & Coordination (10 agents)
- **Project Management**: ai-product-manager, ai-scrum-master, product-manager
- **Agent Orchestration**: ai-agent-orchestrator, task-assignment-coordinator
- **System Management**: agi-system-architect, autonomous-system-controller

### Security & Compliance (8 agents)
- **Security Analysis**: semgrep-security-analyzer, adversarial-attack-detector
- **Privacy**: private-data-analyst, bias-and-fairness-auditor
- **Governance**: ethical-governor, secrets-vault-manager-vault

### Utility & Support (4 agents)
- **System Maintenance**: system-optimizer-reorganizer, garbage-collector
- **Documentation**: document-knowledge-manager, system-knowledge-curator

## Workflow Architecture Principles

### 1. Task-Based Routing
- Tasks are analyzed for type, complexity, and requirements
- Routing decisions use capability matching and current load
- Fallback agents handle edge cases and failures

### 2. Hierarchical Processing
- Simple tasks → Specialist agents
- Complex tasks → Multi-agent workflows
- Critical tasks → Validation chains

### 3. Resource Optimization
- Connection pooling for Ollama integration
- Circuit breakers for resilience
- Queue management for load balancing

### 4. Monitoring & Feedback
- Real-time health monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Automated error recovery

## Getting Started

1. **For Developers**: Start with [Common Development Workflows](workflows/development-workflows.md)
2. **For DevOps**: See [Infrastructure Deployment Patterns](workflows/infrastructure-workflows.md)
3. **For Product Teams**: Review [Project Management Workflows](workflows/project-management-workflows.md)
4. **For AI Engineers**: Explore [AI/ML Pipeline Workflows](workflows/ai-ml-workflows.md)

## Usage Examples

### Simple Task Routing
```python
# Basic task submission to SutazAI
task = {
    "type": "code_review",
    "content": "path/to/code",
    "priority": "high"
}
# System automatically routes to appropriate agents
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow
```python
# Complex deployment workflow
workflow = {
    "name": "full_deployment",
    "stages": [
        {"agent": "testing-qa-validator", "task": "run_tests"},
        {"agent": "security-pentesting-specialist", "task": "security_scan"},
        {"agent": "deployment-automation-master", "task": "deploy"}
    ]
}
```

### Error Handling
```python
# Automatic error recovery
if agent_fails:
    backup_agent = get_backup_agent(original_agent_type)
    retry_with_fallback(task, backup_agent)
```
