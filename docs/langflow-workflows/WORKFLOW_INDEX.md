## Common Workflow Patterns

### 1. Single-Agent Tasks
**When to Use:** Simple, specialized tasks that require domain expertise
**Pattern:** Direct task assignment to specialist agent
**Examples:**
- Code formatting
- Security scan
- Database query
- File processing

### 2. Sequential Workflows
**When to Use:** Tasks that require step-by-step processing with dependencies
**Pattern:** Pipeline with quality gates between stages
**Examples:**
- CI/CD deployment
- Data processing pipeline
- Code review process
- Model training workflow

### 3. Parallel Processing
**When to Use:** Independent sub-tasks that can be executed simultaneously
**Pattern:** Task decomposition with parallel execution and result aggregation
**Examples:**
- Multi-file code analysis
- Comprehensive security audit
- Load testing across environments
- Multi-model inference

### 4. Collaborative Decision Making
**When to Use:** Complex decisions requiring multiple perspectives
**Pattern:** Multi-agent voting or consensus building
**Examples:**
- Architecture decisions
- Technology selection
- Risk assessment
- Quality evaluation

### 5. Hierarchical Coordination
**When to Use:** Complex projects requiring oversight and coordination
**Pattern:** Lead agent coordinating specialist agents
**Examples:**
- Full-stack development
- System migration
- Performance optimization
- Disaster recovery

## Best Practices Guide

### Task Design
1. **Clear Objectives**: Define specific, measurable outcomes
2. **Appropriate Scope**: Match task complexity to agent capabilities
3. **Error Handling**: Include fallback strategies and error recovery
4. **Quality Gates**: Implement validation at each workflow stage

### Agent Selection
1. **Capability Matching**: Align agent expertise with task requirements
2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute work across available agents
3. **Fallback Planning**: Define backup agents for critical tasks
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track agent efficiency and success rates

### Workflow Optimization
1. **Parallel Execution**: Identify independent tasks for concurrent processing
2. **Resource Management**: Optimize memory, CPU, and network usage
3. **Caching Strategies**: Reduce redundant processing through intelligent caching
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Implement comprehensive observability

### Integration Patterns
1. **API Design**: Create clean, consistent interfaces between components
2. **Authentication**: Implement secure, token-based authentication
3. **Rate Limiting**: Protect services from overload
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures in distributed systems

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Agent Unavailable**: Check agent health status and load balancing
2. **Task Timeout**: Review task complexity and resource allocation
3. **Quality Gate Failure**: Analyze validation criteria and agent output
4. **Integration Errors**: Verify API credentials and network connectivity

### Debugging Tools
1. **Workflow Visualization**: Real-time workflow execution monitoring
2. **Agent Health Dashboard**: Comprehensive agent status and metrics
3. **Error Tracking**: Centralized error logging and analysis
4. **Performance Profiling**: Task execution timing and resource usage

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Automatic Retry**: Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
2. **Fallback Agents**: Alternative agent assignment for failed tasks
3. **Manual Intervention**: Human override capabilities for critical situations
4. **System Rollback**: Ability to revert to previous stable state

## Performance Optimization

### Metrics to Monitor
- Task completion time and success rate
- Agent utilization and queue depth
