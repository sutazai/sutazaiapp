# Fantasy Terms Replacement Guide

This document provides the mapping of fantasy/magical terms to professional technical terms.

## Rule 1 Enforcement

All fantasy elements have been replaced with real, grounded technical terms.

## Replacement Mapping

| Fantasy Term | Technical Replacement | Usage Context |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| magic | automated | General automation |
| wizard | configuration | Setup processes |
| magical | automated | Adjective form |
| enchant | enhance | Improvement processes |
| spell | configuration | Settings/parameters |
| summon | instantiate | Object creation |
| invoke | call | Function calls |
| teleport | transfer | Data movement |
| mystical | advanced | Complex features |
| divine | optimal | Best practices |
| sacred | protected | Security contexts |
| blessed | validated | Verified states |
| cursed | deprecated | Obsolete features |

## Code Examples

### Before (Fantasy Terms)
```python
def magicTransform(data):
    wizard_config = summon_settings()
    return enchanted_data
```

### After (Technical Terms)
```python
def dataTransform(data):
    config_settings = createSettings()
    return processedData
```

## Verification

All fantasy terms have been systematically replaced while preserving functionality.
No metaphors, magic terms, or hypothetical constructs remain in the codebase.
