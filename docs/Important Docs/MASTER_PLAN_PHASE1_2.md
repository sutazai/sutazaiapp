Below is the continuation from the Directory Reorganization step. We'll now cover the next phases of the master plan:
──────────────────────────────
Virtual Environment & Dependencies
• In /opt/SutazAI, create a Python virtual environment:
    - Run:
         python3 -m venv venv
         source venv/bin/activate
• Upgrade and install packages:
    - Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel:
         pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    - Install dependencies using requirements.txt. Use an offline fallback with locally stored wheels if needed:
         pip install -r requirements.txt || pip install --no-index --find-links=packages/wheels -r requirements.txt
• Document these steps in /docs/DEPLOYMENT.md so that the environment setup is recorded.
──────────────────────────────
Initial Code Audit
    - Code analysis via semgrep (e.g., semgrep --config=auto .)
    - Linting with pylint (e.g., pylint backend/)
    - Static type checking with mypy (e.g., mypy .)
• Additionally, perform a manual review of critical components—such as scripts (deploy.sh), the backend (main.py, services), and AI agents—to flag any outdated dependencies or suspicious code.
• Summarize findings and potential fixes in an audit document (for instance, /docs/audit/Audit_Report_v1.md).
──────────────────────────────
Phase 2: Two‑Server Synchronization & Supreme AI Orchestrator Deployment
A. Two‑Server Sync Setup
• On the Code Server:
    - Switch to the dedicated user (e.g., sutazai_dev)
    - Create a new SSH key (for example, using ed25519) specifically for deployment:
         ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "sutazai_deploy" -f ~/.ssh/sutazai_deploy -N ""
    - Copy the public key to the Deployment Server:
         ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/sutazai_deploy.pub root@192.168.100.100
• In the repository's .git/hooks/, add a post-commit hook so that every commit triggers an automated sync:
    - Example in .git/hooks/post-commit:
         #!/bin/bash
         ssh root@192.168.100.100 "cd /opt/SutazAI && ./scripts/trigger_deploy.sh"
         (chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit)
• Alternatively, prepare a dedicated repository sync script, such as scripts/setup_repos.sh, that:
    - Navigates to /opt/SutazAI
    - Performs a git fetch/reset to origin/master
    - Adjusts permissions (chmod +x scripts/setup_repos.sh)
• Document these sync details in /docs/REPO_SYNC.md.
B. Supreme AI Orchestrator Deployment
• Configure the orchestrator:
    - In /ai_agents/superagi/config.toml, set the owner's information:
         [owner]
         name = "Florin Cristian Suta"
         email = "chrissuta01@gmail.com"
         phone = "+48517716005"
• Create a startup script to launch the orchestrator:
    - For example, create scripts/start_superagi.sh with content like:
         #!/bin/bash
         cd /opt/SutazAI/ai_agents/superagi
         nohup python3 supreme_agent.py >> /opt/SutazAI/logs/agent.log 2>&1 &
    - And make sure to update its permission with:
         chmod +x scripts/start_superagi.sh
• Ensure the orchestrator logs its activities in JSON format. For instance:
         import logging, json
         logger = logging.getLogger("superagi_orchestrator")
         logger.info(json.dumps({"event": "start", "owner": "Florin Cristian Suta"}))
• Test the orchestrator deployment by running the script on the Deployment Server and then verifying the logs at /opt/SutazAI/logs/agent.log.
──────────────────────────────
Phase 3: Automated Deployment Pipeline & Dependency Resolution
Objective:
Develop a robust deployment script (deploy.sh) to automate environment setup, dependency management, OTP enforcement, health checks, logging, and error-triggered rollback.

Detailed Steps:
- The deploy.sh script should:
    1. Execute a git pull to update the repository with the latest changes.
    2. Validate any external dependency calls via OTP using scripts/otp_override.py.
    3. Check for and, if necessary, create the Python virtual environment.
    4. Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel, then install dependencies (with an offline fallback using packages/wheels).
    5. Verify that required model files (e.g., GPT4All/model.bin, DeepSeek-Coder/model.bin) are present in /opt/SutazAI/model_management.
    6. Start backend services (using uvicorn for FastAPI) and the web UI, performing health checks (e.g., via curl) to ensure responsiveness.
    7. Log all activities to /opt/SutazAI/logs/deploy.log.
    8. Implement a rollback mechanism: if any step fails, reset to a stable commit and re-deploy, logging the rollback event.

──────────────────────────────
Phase 4: Document & Diagram Parsing Integration
Objective:
Implement modules to parse PDF and DOCX documents and to analyze diagrams (with placeholders where integration with tools like Molmo is pending).

Detailed Steps:
- Develop a document parsing module (e.g., in backend/services/doc_processing.py) that uses libraries such as fitz (for PDFs) and docx2txt (for DOCX).
- Create a diagram parsing module (e.g., in backend/services/diagram_parser.py) that provides placeholder analysis of diagram files.
- Create FastAPI endpoints for file uploads:
    • /doc/parse for document parsing
    • /diagram/analyze for diagram analysis
  These endpoints should return JSON-formatted results.
- Build simple UI components (e.g., in React) to allow users to upload documents and diagrams for testing the parsing functionality.

──────────────────────────────
Phase 5: Advanced Code Generation & Autonomous Development
Objective:
Integrate local LLMs (e.g., GPT4All, DeepSeek-Coder) to generate code from textual specifications and leverage multi-agent synergy (using platforms such as AutoGPT, Semgrep, TabbyML, and LangChain) for refining and scanning the code.

Detailed Steps:
- Create a code generation module (e.g., in backend/services/code_generation.py) that:
    • Generates code based on provided specifications using a local LLM.
    • Optionally scans the generated code (e.g., using semgrep) to highlight potential issues.
- Develop a FastAPI endpoint (e.g., /code/generate) to handle code generation requests.
- Build a UI panel (e.g., CodeGeneration.jsx) where users can enter code specifications, select a model, and view generated code with syntax highlighting.

──────────────────────────────
Phase 6: OTP-Based Online Override & Self‑Improvement Routines
Objective:
Mandate OTP verification for any external operations and enable the orchestrator to self-improve based on system performance and error monitoring.

Detailed Steps:
- Update scripts/otp_override.py to validate OTP tokens before allowing external operations (e.g., dependency installations or API calls).
- Integrate monitoring into the orchestrator to track metrics such as document parse times and code generation error rates.
- If performance thresholds are exceeded or errors are repeatedly logged, trigger automated code regeneration or initiate a rollback.
- Log all self-improvement actions with detailed reasons for traceability.

──────────────────────────────
Phase 7: Final Audit, Documentation & Handoff
Objective:
Conduct a comprehensive final audit, consolidate documentation, and prepare a handoff package complete with training materials.

Detailed Steps:
- Perform exhaustive audits using tools like semgrep, pylint, mypy, and bandit.
- Prepare final audit reports (e.g., /docs/audit/Audit_Report_vFinal.md) and tag the stable release (e.g., v1.0.0-final).
- Assemble a handoff package with a final code archive (excluding the virtual environment) and detailed deployment instructions.

──────────────────────────────
Phase 8: Continuous Maintenance, Observability & Advanced CI/CD
Objective:
Implement real-time observability, advanced logging, and a CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous system integration, testing, and health monitoring.

Detailed Steps:
- Deploy monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance and resource use.
- Configure structured JSON logging and set up log rotation (using logrotate) for logs in /opt/SutazAI/logs.
- Integrate alert mechanisms (via email or Slack) for critical events such as rollbacks or OTP failures.

──────────────────────────────
Phase 9: Final Handoff, Training & Future Scalability
Objective:
Provide a comprehensive final system archive, training materials, and a roadmap for future scalability improvements.

Detailed Steps:
- Pull the latest changes and create a final code archive (excluding the virtual environment) with a command such as:
    tar -czvf sutazai_final_handoff.tar.gz /opt/SutazAI --exclude=venv
- Update documentation with final handoff instructions (e.g., /docs/Handoff.md) and include detailed deployment guidelines.
- Develop training materials and onboarding guides (in PDF or video formats) to aid new developers in deploying and operating the system.
- Outline future scalability enhancements, such as GPU integration for larger LLMs and multi-region orchestration.

──────────────────────────────
Conclusion & Next Steps
- Initiate immediate actions based on the deliverables from Phases 1 and 2, then gradually implement Phases 3 through 9.
- Ensure continuous documentation updates across all phases to reflect changes, improvements, and testing results.
- Leverage the established OTP and rollback frameworks to safeguard the system from errors and unauthorized external access.
- Prepare for a comprehensive final audit and handoff to ensure a smooth transition and long-term maintainability of the SutazAI platform.

This detailed master plan outlines the journey towards transforming the SutazAI platform into a secure, automated, and self-improving system ready for production deployment.
