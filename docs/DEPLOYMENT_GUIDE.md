## Deployment Strategies

### Local Development
```bash
./deploy.sh deploy local
# - Fast startup
# - Development configurations
# - Debug logging enabled
# - Local file mounting
```

### Blue-Green Production
```bash
./deploy.sh deploy blue-green
# - Zero-downtime deployment
# - Traffic switching
# - Automatic rollback
# - Health verification
```

### Optimized Resource-Constrained
```bash
LIGHTWEIGHT_MODE=true ./deploy.sh deploy optimized
# - Minimal resource usage
# - Essential services only
# - Reduced memory footprint
# - Single-node deployment
```

### Auto-scaling with Kubernetes
```bash
PLATFORM=kubernetes ./deploy.sh autoscale
# - Horizontal pod autoscaling
# - Service mesh integration
# - Load balancing
# - Resource quotas
```

## Operational Procedures

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] System resources verified (16GB+ RAM, 100GB+ disk)
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose v2 installed
- [ ] Network connectivity confirmed
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Monitoring configured

### Deployment Process
1. **Pre-checks**: System validation and resource verification
2. **Self-update**: Latest script version pulled from repository  
3. **Environment setup**: Configuration and secrets management
4. **Infrastructure**: Core databases and vector services
5. **Application**: Backend API and frontend UI
6. **Agents**: AI agent services deployment
7. **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, logging stack
8. **Validation**: Health checks and smoke tests
9. **Finalization**: State persistence and cleanup

### Rollback Process
1. **Detection**: Automatic failure detection or manual trigger
2. **State capture**: Current deployment state preserved
3. **Service shutdown**: Graceful service termination
4. **Data restoration**: Database and configuration rollback
5. **Service restart**: Previous version activation
6. **Verification**: Health checks and functionality tests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Git Update Failures**
```bash
# Skip self-update for testing
export SUTAZAI_SKIP_UPDATE=true
./deploy.sh deploy local
```

**Resource Constraints**
```bash
# Use lightweight mode
LIGHTWEIGHT_MODE=true ./deploy.sh deploy optimized
```

**Service Failures**
```bash
# Check specific service logs
./deploy.sh logs [service-name]

# Validate configuration
./deploy.sh validate

# Force cleanup and retry
./deploy.sh cleanup
./deploy.sh deploy fresh
```

**Network Issues**
```bash
# Check network configuration
docker network ls
docker network inspect sutazai-network

# Recreate network
docker network rm sutazai-network
docker network create sutazai-network
```

### Recovery Procedures

**Complete System Recovery**
```bash
# Stop all services
./deploy.sh cleanup

# Deploy fresh installation
./deploy.sh deploy fresh

# Restore from backup if needed
./deploy.sh rollback [backup-point]
```

**Partial Service Recovery**
```bash
# Restart specific services
docker-compose restart [service-name]

# Validate deployment
./deploy.sh health

# Check logs
./deploy.sh logs [service-name]
```

## Script Consolidation Details

## Migration from Old Scripts

If you have existing deployment workflows using the old scripts:

1. **Update CI/CD pipelines** to use `./deploy.sh deploy [target]`
2. **Update documentation** to reference the new unified interface
3. **Train team members** on the new command structure
4. **Archive old scripts** (already backed up automatically)
5. **Monitor first deployments** to ensure smooth transition

## Next Steps

1. **Test deployments** in development environment
2. **Validate production readiness** with staging deployments  
3. **Update operational runbooks** with new procedures
4. **Train operations team** on unified deployment interface
5. **Monitor deployment metrics** and optimize performance
6. **Schedule regular backup validation** to ensure recovery capabilities
