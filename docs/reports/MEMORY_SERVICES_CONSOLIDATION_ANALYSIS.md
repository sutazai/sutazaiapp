## 4. Data Migration Assessment

### Data Formats and Schemas

#### Extended-Memory Schema:
```sql
-- contexts table
CREATE TABLE contexts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    importance_level INTEGER DEFAULT 5,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- context_tags table  
CREATE TABLE context_tags (
    context_id INTEGER,
    tag TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (context_id) REFERENCES contexts(id)
);

-- projects table
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

#### Memory-Bank-MCP Schema:
```sql
-- projects table
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- files table
CREATE TABLE files (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INTEGER,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id)
);
```

### Export/Import Capabilities

#### Extended-Memory Export:
- **Native export** via storage provider API
- **JSON format** with full metadata
- **Batch operations** supported
- **Tag preservation** included

#### Memory-Bank-MCP Export:
- **Manual export** via database queries
- **Basic file structure** without metadata
- **No built-in export tools**
- **Limited metadata** preservation

### Data Compatibility Analysis

#### Migration Complexity: **LOW to MEDIUM**

**Compatible Elements:**
- Project organization (both use project-based storage)
- Content storage (both store text content)  
- Temporal tracking (both have created/updated timestamps)

**Incompatible Elements:**
- Importance levels (memory-bank has none)
- Tag systems (memory-bank has none)
- File naming (memory-bank uses explicit names vs. auto-generated IDs)

### Migration Strategy

#### Step 1: Data Extraction from Memory-Bank-MCP
```sql
SELECT 
    p.name as project_name,
    f.filename,
    f.content,
    f.created_at,
    f.updated_at
FROM files f
JOIN projects p ON f.project_id = p.id
ORDER BY f.created_at;
```

#### Step 2: Data Transformation  
```python
def transform_memory_bank_to_extended(file_record):
    return {
        'project_id': file_record['project_name'],
        'content': f"File: {file_record['filename']}\n\n{file_record['content']}",
        'importance_level': 5,  # Default importance
        'tags': ['migrated', 'file'],  # Migration tags
        'created_at': file_record['created_at'],
        'updated_at': file_record['updated_at']
    }
```

#### Step 3: Data Import to Extended-Memory
```python
async def migrate_memory_bank_data(extended_memory_service, transformed_data):
    for record in transformed_data:
        await extended_memory_service.save_context(**record)
```

## 5. Consolidation Strategy

### Recommended Primary Service: **Extended-Memory**

#### Rationale:
1. **Superior Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns, better error handling
2. **Advanced Features** - Tagging, importance levels, analytics  
3. **Better Performance** - Redis caching, optimized queries
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Built-in test suite and coverage
5. **Active Development** - More recent updates and improvements
6. **Scalability** - Designed for high-volume usage

### Feature Integration Plan

#### Features to Preserve from Memory-Bank-MCP:

1. **File-Centric API** - Add file-based operations to extended-memory:
   ```python
   async def save_file(project_id: str, filename: str, content: str) -> dict:
       """Save content as a named file within a project"""
       return await save_context(
           content=f"File: {filename}\n\n{content}",
           project_id=project_id,
           tags=['file', filename.split('.')[-1]],  # Add file extension as tag
           importance_level=5
       )
   ```

2. **Simple CRUD Interface** - Add to extended-memory tools:
   ```python
   async def list_project_files(project_id: str) -> List[str]:
       """List files in project (contexts tagged as 'file')"""
       contexts = await load_contexts(project_id=project_id, tags_filter=['file'])
       return [extract_filename_from_content(ctx['content']) for ctx in contexts]
   ```

3. **FastMCP Integration** - Migrate extended-memory to FastMCP framework for modern MCP support

#### Features to Enhance in Extended-Memory:

1. **Explicit File Management** - Add filename metadata to contexts
2. **Better Project Organization** - Enhanced project hierarchy

3. **Phase 3:** Deprecate and remove memory-bank-mcp
4. **Phase 4:** Optimize and enhance the unified service

### Key Actions Required:

#### Immediate (Next 1-2 days):
- [ ] Create detailed migration plan with technical specifications
- [ ] Develop and test data migration scripts
- [ ] Set up staging environment for migration testing
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of planned consolidation

#### Short-term (Next 1-2 weeks):
- [ ] Execute migration in staging environment
- [ ] Validate all functionality and performance
- [ ] Train team on unified memory service
- [ ] Execute production migration

#### Long-term (Next 1-2 months):
- [ ] Monitor unified service performance and stability
- [ ] Optimize performance and add new features
- [ ] Document lessons learned and best practices
- [ ] Plan future memory service enhancements

### Alternative Considerations:

#### Option 2: Keep Both Services (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- **Pros:** No migration risk, maintain existing functionality
- **Cons:** Continued maintenance overhead, user confusion, technical debt

#### Option 3: Consolidate to Memory-Bank-MCP (NOT RECOMMENDED)  
- **Pros:** Simpler architecture, FastMCP integration
- **Cons:** Loss of advanced features, inferior performance, limited scalability

## Conclusion

The analysis clearly demonstrates that consolidating the two memory services into a unified extended-memory service will provide significant benefits while maintaining all critical functionality. The migration is low-risk with proper planning and execution, and the long-term benefits justify the short-term effort required.

**Next Steps:** Proceed with detailed migration planning and staging environment setup to begin the consolidation process.
