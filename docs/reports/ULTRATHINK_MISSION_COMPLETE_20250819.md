## üéØ KEY DISCOVERIES

### Critical Findings
1. **Task Coordinator is healthy** - Running on port 4000, not 8551
2. **RabbitMQ was already deployed** - Incorrectly documented as missing
3. **Grafana is running** - Was marked as not deployed
4. **FAISS is operational** - Previously marked as not deployed
5. **30 total services running** - Not "completely down" as claimed

### Infrastructure Reality
- **24 host containers** + **6 MCP in DinD** = **30 total**
- **21 healthy**, **6 running**, **3 unhealthy**
- All critical services operational
- System is 90% functional, not "dead"

## üìù VERIFICATION COMMANDS

Every claim verified with these commands:
```bash
# System health
curl http://localhost:10010/health
curl -I http://localhost:10011

# Container status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

# MCP servers
