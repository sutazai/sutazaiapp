1. **Initial Response** (0-2 minutes)
   - Alert acknowledgment
   - Incident classification
   - Team notification

2. **Investigation** (2-15 minutes)
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Mitigation planning

3. **Resolution** (15+ minutes)
   - Fix implementation
   - Service restoration
   - Verification testing

4. **Post-Incident** (1-48 hours)
   - Blameless post-mortem
   - Documentation updates
   - Prevention measures

### SLA Targets Established
- **Availability**: 99.9% for core platform, 99.5% for AI agents
- **Response Times**: P0 <2min, P1 <15min, P2 <1hr, P3 <4hr
- **Performance**: API P95 <2s, AI inference P95 <30s
