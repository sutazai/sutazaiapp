## 🔄 Before vs After

### Script Organization
**Before:**
```
scripts/
├── 244 individual Python files
├── Massive duplication
├── Inconsistent patterns
├── No proper imports
└── Maintenance nightmare
```

**After:**
```
scripts/
├── utils/ (4 modules) → 363 scripts consolidated
├── monitoring/ (2 modules) → 218 scripts consolidated  
├── deployment/ (2 modules) → 101 scripts consolidated
├── testing/ (2 modules) → 284 scripts consolidated
├── automation/ → Ready for expansion
