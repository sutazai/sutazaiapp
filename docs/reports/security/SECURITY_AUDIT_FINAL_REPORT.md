| PCI DSS | ‚úÖ READY | Data protection controls |

## SECURITY ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS

### Defense in Depth Implementation
1. **Network Layer:** Service mesh with encrypted communication
2. **Application Layer:** Input validation, rate limiting, security headers
3. **Container Layer:** Non-root users, minimal attack surface
4. **Runtime Layer:** Circuit breakers, health monitoring
5. **Data Layer:** Encrypted storage, access controls

### Security Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Automated threat detection
- Security incident response procedures
- Comprehensive audit logging

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ONGOING SECURITY

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)
1. Deploy SSL/TLS certificates for production
2. Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
3. Configure centralized security logging
