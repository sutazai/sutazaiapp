- Unicode characters: ‚úÖ Detected (–º–∞–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π_–æ–±—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—á–∏–∫)
- Obfuscated patterns: ‚ùå Not detected (mag1c_h4ndl3r) - Expected limitation
- String contexts: ‚úÖ Properly flagged as violations

   - **Resolution:** Start Ollama service or configure alternative endpoint

2. **Dashboard Service Availability** üî¥  
   - **Impact:** Real-time monitoring dashboard unavailable
   - **Status:** Backend service not responding on port 8080
   - **Workaround:** Command-line tools fully functional
   - **Resolution:** Start monitoring backend service

### Minor Issues

3. **Stack Overflow Prevention** üü°
   - **Status:** Mitigation code present but unable to test live system
   - **Impact:** Low - prevention mechanisms implemented
   - **Validation:** Code review confirms proper implementation

4. **Fantasy Element Detection Coverage** üü°
   - **Issue:** Obfuscated patterns (l33t speak) not detected
   - **Impact:** Low - sophisticated obfuscation rare in practice
   - **Recommendation:** Add pattern variants if needed
