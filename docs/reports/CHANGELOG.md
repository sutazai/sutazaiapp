## [Unreleased]

## [2025-08-18] - Service Mesh Investigation

### Added
- `SERVICE_MESH_INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive investigation of service mesh failures
  - Identified critical architectural flaws in DinD implementation
  - Documented network isolation issues preventing MCP service access
  - Revealed fictional port mappings (11100+ don't exist)
  - Exposed Kong gateway misconfiguration
  - Provided evidence of Consul health check failures
  - Created testing commands to verify issues
  - Recommended architectural fixes

### Discovered
- Service mesh is fundamentally broken, not "partially operational"
- Only 3 MCP containers running in DinD, not 19 as claimed
- Ports 11100-11118 registered in Consul are fictional
- No working network bridge between DinD and host
- All Kong routes return 404 or connection refused
- All MCP services show CRITICAL in Consul health checks

### Scripts Created
- `/scripts/mesh/fix_service_mesh.py` - Attempted fix script (requires sudo, timed out)
- `/scripts/mesh/direct_mesh_fix.py` - Direct fix attempt (revealed IP parsing issues)

## [Previous Reports]
- Multiple investigation reports exist but lack proper tracking
- Reports contain conflicting information about system state
- Many claims of "100% compliance" and "working" systems proven false
