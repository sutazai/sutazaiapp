## 9. Conclusion

The analysis reveals significant optimization opportunities in the current MCP server deployment. By implementing the recommended consolidations and removals, we can achieve:

- **19% reduction** in container count
- **496MB memory savings** (9.6% reduction)
- **$53.28 annual cost savings**
- **Simplified architecture** with fewer dependencies
- **Improved maintainability** and operational efficiency

The highest-value services (files, http, postgres, memory services) should be retained and optimized, while low-value duplicate services (puppeteer-mcp (no longer in use), mcp_ssh, ddg) should be removed immediately. The implementation can be completed in phases over 4 weeks with minimal risk and comprehensive testing.
