## Technical Analysis & Root Cause Resolution

### üîç Root Cause Identified
The 122/123 request failures were caused by:
1. **Performance Bottleneck**: Ollama generation requests taking 27+ seconds
2. **Connection Timeouts**: HTTP clients timing out before responses complete  
3. **Circuit Breaker Trips**: Accumulated failures triggering service isolation
4. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Hung connections blocking new requests

- **Smart Connection Recovery**: Exponential backoff with automatic retry
- **Request Prioritization**: High/normal/batch priority queues
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics with auto-adjustment
- **Circuit Breaker Optimization**: Enhanced failure thresholds and recovery

#### 2. Integration Layer (`ollama_ultra_integration.py`)
- **Drop-in Replacement**: Compatible with existing API
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized concurrent request handling
- **Smart Caching**: TTL-based response caching for performance

#### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (`ultra_ollama_test.py`)
