## Infrastructure Reality Check

### Documentation Claims vs Reality

| Claim | Documentation | **Actual State** | **Status** |
|-------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| MCP Services | "21/21 operational" | 0 containers running in DinD | ‚ùå **FALSE CLAIM** |
| Container Status | "All containerized and isolated" | Empty DinD orchestrator | ‚ùå **FALSE CLAIM** |
| Service Health | "100% functional" | No services actually deployed | ‚ùå **FALSE CLAIM** |
| Architecture | "DinD isolation successful" | Networks exist, no containers | ‚ùå **MISLEADING** |

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Despite extensive documentation claiming operational MCP services, **ZERO containers are actually running** in the DinD environment. This represents a complete disconnect between documentation and reality.

### Actual Infrastructure State
```bash
# Evidence from investigation:
docker exec sutazai-mcp-orchestrator-notls docker ps -q | wc -l
# OUTPUT: 0

# No running containers despite claims of 21 operational services
# Networks and volumes allocated but unused
# Monitoring stack running for non-existent services
```
