CPU Throttling: Not detected
```
**Assessment**: CPU resources are abundant, no processing bottlenecks.

### 3. Network Bottlenecks: ✅ NONE DETECTED
```
Port 4000: LISTEN (healthy)
Connections: 3 TIME_WAIT (normal cleanup)
Response Times:
├── Health endpoint: 9ms
├── Metrics endpoint: 12ms
└── Concurrent (5x): 12ms total
```
**Assessment**: Network performance is excellent with sub-15ms responses.

### 4. API Response Bottlenecks: ✅ MINIMAL IMPACT
```
Service Response Times:
├── UltimateCoder: 38ms (Python subprocess)
├── Language Server: 9ms (Node.js native)
└── Sequential Thinking: 8ms (Node.js native)
```
**Assessment**: Only minor bottleneck in Python subprocess creation.

### 5. I/O Bottlenecks: ✅ NONE DETECTED
```
File Descriptors: 19 (very low)
Disk I/O: Minimal activity
File System: Responsive
```
**Assessment**: I/O operations are efficient with no contention.

### 6. Process Management: ✅ OPTIMAL
```
Active Processes: 0 (perfect cleanup)
Process Registry:
├── Python: 0 active
├── Go: 0 active
└── Node.js: 0 active
```
**Assessment**: Process cleanup is working perfectly, no resource leaks.

## 🎯 Identified Bottleneck Areas

### Minor Bottleneck: Python Subprocess Creation
**Impact**: Low (28-38ms for UltimateCoder requests)  
**Cause**: Process spawning overhead for Python bridge  
**Frequency**: Per UltimateCoder request

**Analysis**:
- Python subprocess creation adds 28-38ms overhead
- This is acceptable for non-real-time operations
- Alternative would be persistent Python process

### Non-Issue: False Memory Alert
**MCP Tool Alert**: Memory usage >80% (false positive)  
**Reality**: 3.6% actual memory usage  
**Cause**: Tool miscalibration or different measurement basis

## 💡 Optimization Recommendations

### 🚀 High Impact Optimizations

#### 1. Python Process Pooling (Optional Enhancement)
```javascript
// Potential improvement for high-frequency UltimateCoder usage
const pythonPool = new ProcessPool({
  min: 1,
  max: 3,
  idleTimeout: 300000 // 5 minutes
});
```
**Estimated Benefit**: 50-70% reduction in UltimateCoder response time  
**Trade-off**: Slightly higher memory usage (10-20MB)  
**Recommendation**: Implement if UltimateCoder usage >100 requests/hour

#### 2. Response Caching (Low Priority)
```javascript
// Cache common language server responses
const lspCache = new LRUCache({
  max: 1000,
  ttl: 300000 // 5 minutes
});
```
**Estimated Benefit**: 80-90% reduction for repeated queries  
**Trade-off**: 2-5MB additional memory usage  
**Recommendation**: Consider for production with repeated patterns

### 🔧 Fine-Tuning Opportunities

#### 1. Health Check Optimization
Current: 30-second intervals  
**Recommended**: 60-second intervals (reduce overhead)  
**Benefit**: Minimal CPU reduction

#### 2. Memory Limit Adjustment
Current: 512MB limit  
**Recommended**: 256MB limit (still 7x current usage)  
**Benefit**: Better resource allocation for other services
