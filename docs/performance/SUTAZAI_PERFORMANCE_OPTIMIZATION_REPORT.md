- Ollama Service: 1.014GB/4GB (25% utilization - optimal)
- Infrastructure: Various containers using <100MB each
- Total System Memory: ~4-5GB actual vs 29GB available (17% utilization)
```

```

## Bottleneck Analysis and Root Causes

### 1. Agent Health Check Failures
**Issue**: Most agents showing "unhealthy" status
**Impact**: Prevents full system utilization
**Root Cause**: 
- Health endpoint configuration mismatches
- Service initialization timing issues
- Dependency resolution delays

### 2. Service Discovery and Registration
**Issue**: Agents not properly registering with Consul
**Impact**: Reduces effective agent pool utilization
**Root Cause**:
- Network connectivity issues between agents and service mesh
- Configuration drift in service registration

### 3. Resource Allocation Inefficiency
**Issue**: Over-provisioned resources not being utilized
**Impact**: System running at 1.4% capacity instead of potential 100%
**Root Cause**:
- Static resource allocation model
- No dynamic scaling based on actual workload

## Performance Forecasting Models

```
Time Horizon: 30 days
Agent Utilization Trend: Remains at 1-5%
Resource Waste: 95% of allocated resources unused
System Throughput: <10 requests/minute across all agents

```

### Scenario 2: Optimized Configuration (With Interventions)
```
Time Horizon: 7 days to full optimization
Agent Utilization Projection: 85-95% within 48 hours
Resource Efficiency: 70-80% memory utilization
System Throughput: 500+ requests/minute

```

### Scenario 3: Peak Load Forecast
```
Time Horizon: Under load testing
Agent Utilization: 100% (all 69 agents active)
Memory Requirement: 8-12GB (within available 29GB)
CPU Requirement: 15-25 cores (system has 32+ cores)
Throughput Capacity: 2000+ requests/minute
```

## Dynamic Resource Allocation Strategy

### 1. Memory Pool Management
```yaml
Dynamic Allocation Model:
  Initial Allocation: 128MB per agent (down from 512MB)
  Scaling Trigger: >80% memory usage
  Scale-up Increment: 256MB steps
  Maximum Limit: 1GB per agent
  Total Pool: 16GB available for dynamic allocation
```

### 2. CPU Scheduling Optimization
```yaml
CPU Management:
  Base Allocation: 0.1 CPU per agent
  Burst Allocation: Up to 1.0 CPU for active agents
  Priority Queuing: Critical agents get higher CPU priority
  Load Balancing: Distribute workload across available cores
```

### 3. Agent Pooling Configuration
```yaml
Agent Pool Strategy:
  Hot Pool: 20 agents (always running)
  Warm Pool: 30 agents (ready to start in <30s)
  Cold Pool: 19 agents (on-demand activation)
  Auto-scaling: Based on request queue depth
```

## Workload Distribution Framework

### 1. Intelligent Request Routing
```python
# Workload Distribution Algorithm
routing_strategy = {
    "load_balancing": "weighted_round_robin",
    "health_aware": True,
    "capacity_based": True,
    "latency_optimized": True
}

agent_weights = {
    "high_performance": 0.4,  # Ollama-optimized agents
    "standard": 0.3,          # Regular agents
    "specialized": 0.3        # Domain-specific agents
}
```

### 2. Queue Management System
```yaml
Request Queue Configuration:
  Max Queue Size: 10000 requests
  Queue Timeout: 300 seconds
  Priority Levels: 3 (high, medium, low)
  Overflow Strategy: "route_to_available_agent"
  Dead Letter Queue: Enabled for failed requests
```
