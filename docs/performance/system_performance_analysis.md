```

### Container Health Analysis
**Critical Findings:**
- **46% containers in restart loops** (43/94)
- **76% containers unhealthy** (71/94) 
- **Primary Issues:**
  - Resource allocation conflicts

- Memory allocation: 512MB per agent (12GB total)
- Current resource reservation: 256MB per agent minimum
- CPU allocation: 0.5 cores per agent (12 cores total if all active)

## Identified Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. Memory Pressure and Allocation
**Current Issue:**
- Agent services designed for 512MB each
- 69 agents × 512MB = 35.3GB theoretical requirement
- Available memory: 29GB total (19GB free)
- **Memory deficit: 6.3GB shortage when all agents active**

### 2. CPU Resource Contention  
**Current Issue:**
- Load average 5.42 on 12-core system (45% utilization)
- Agent services requesting 0.5 CPU each
- 69 agents × 0.5 CPU = 34.5 cores required
- **CPU deficit: 22.5 cores shortage (187% over-allocation)**

### 3. Container Orchestration Failures
**Root Causes:**
- Dependency chain complexity causing cascade failures
- Insufficient health check timeouts
- Resource competition during startup
- Network port conflicts

### 4. Model Loading and Inference Bottlenecks
**Ollama Analysis:**
- Single TinyLlama model loaded (637MB)
- High API request frequency (multiple checks per second)
- Resource limits: 10 CPU cores, 20GB memory allocated
- **Potential bottleneck for 69 concurrent agents**

**Optimized Resource Needs:**
```
Memory Allocation:

```

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Immediate Optimizations (0-24 hours)

**Container Resource Optimization:**
```yaml
# Implement tiered resource allocation
x-agent-active: &agent-active
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpus: '0.5'
        memory: 512M
      reservations:
        cpus: '0.25'
        memory: 256M

x-agent-standby: &agent-standby
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpus: '0.25'
        memory: 256M
      reservations:
        cpus: '0.1'
        memory: 128M
```

**Model Optimization:**
- Implement model sharing across agents
- Use Redis cache for frequent inference results
- Batch processing for similar requests

**Container Health Fixes:**
- Increase health check timeouts from 10s to 30s
- Implement exponential backoff for restarts
- Fix dependency ordering issues

### 2. Short-term Optimizations (1-7 days)

**Resource Pool Management:**
```python
class AgentResourceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_agents = set()
        self.max_active = 20  # Based on resource capacity
        
    def activate_agent(self, agent_id):
        if len(self.active_agents) >= self.max_active:
            # Move least recently used to standby
            self.deactivate_lru_agent()
        self.active_agents.add(agent_id)
```

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaling:**
