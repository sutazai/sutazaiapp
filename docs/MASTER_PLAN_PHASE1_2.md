Below is the continuation from the Directory Reorganization step. We'll now cover the next phases of the master plan:
──────────────────────────────
Virtual Environment & Dependencies
• In /opt/SutazAI, create a Python virtual environment:
    - Run:
         python3 -m venv venv
         source venv/bin/activate
• Upgrade and install packages:
    - Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel:
         pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    - Install dependencies using requirements.txt. Use an offline fallback with locally stored wheels if needed:
         pip install -r requirements.txt || pip install --no-index --find-links=packages/wheels -r requirements.txt
• Document these steps in /docs/DEPLOYMENT.md so that the environment setup is recorded.
──────────────────────────────
Initial Code Audit
• Run automated security and quality checks:
    - Code analysis via semgrep (e.g., semgrep --config=auto .)
    - Linting with pylint (e.g., pylint backend/)
    - Static type checking with mypy (e.g., mypy .)
    - Security scanning with bandit (e.g., bandit -r .)
• Additionally, perform a manual review of critical components—such as scripts (deploy.sh), the backend (main.py, services), and AI agents—to flag any outdated dependencies or suspicious code.
• Summarize findings and potential fixes in an audit document (for instance, /docs/audit/Audit_Report_v1.md).

Phase 2: Two‑Server Synchronization & Supreme AI Orchestrator Deployment
A. Two‑Server Sync Setup
• On the Code Server:
    - Switch to the dedicated user (e.g., sutazai_dev)
    - Create a new SSH key (for example, using ed25519) specifically for deployment:
         ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "sutazai_deploy" -f ~/.ssh/sutazai_deploy -N ""
    - Copy the public key to the Deployment Server:
         ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/sutazai_deploy.pub root@192.168.100.100
• In the repository's .git/hooks/, add a post-commit hook so that every commit triggers an automated sync:
    - Example in .git/hooks/post-commit:
         #!/bin/bash
         ssh root@192.168.100.100 "cd /opt/SutazAI && ./scripts/trigger_deploy.sh"
         (chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit)
• Alternatively, prepare a dedicated repository sync script, such as scripts/setup_repos.sh, that:
    - Navigates to /opt/SutazAI
    - Performs a git fetch/reset to origin/master
    - Adjusts permissions (chmod +x scripts/setup_repos.sh)
• Document these sync details in /docs/REPO_SYNC.md.
B. Supreme AI Orchestrator Deployment
• Configure the orchestrator:
    - In /ai_agents/superagi/config.toml, set the owner's information:
         [owner]
         name = "Florin Cristian Suta"
         email = "chrissuta01@gmail.com"
         phone = "+48517716005"
• Create a startup script to launch the orchestrator:
    - For example, create scripts/start_superagi.sh with content like:
         #!/bin/bash
         cd /opt/SutazAI/ai_agents/superagi
         nohup python3 supreme_agent.py >> /opt/SutazAI/logs/agent.log 2>&1 &
    - And make sure to update its permission with:
         chmod +x scripts/start_superagi.sh
• Ensure the orchestrator logs its activities in JSON format. For instance:
         import logging, json
         logger = logging.getLogger("superagi_orchestrator")
         logger.info(json.dumps({"event": "start", "owner": "Florin Cristian Suta"}))
• Test the orchestrator deployment by running the script on the Deployment Server and then verifying the logs at /opt/SutazAI/logs/agent.log.
──────────────────────────────
Moving Forward
• With these phases set, the next steps include building out the Automated Deployment Pipeline & Dependency Resolution (Phase 3) and integrating specialized modules (document parsing, code generation, etc.) as described in the complete SutazAI Master Plan.
• It's also critical that the project documentation (in /docs/) is continuously updated with each change—from DEPLOYMENT.md to the audit reports and even CI/CD pipeline documentation.

This continuation builds on your established Directory Reorganization and lays the groundwork for a robust, synchronized deployment and monitoring approach. Let me know if you need further actions or modifications to any particular scripts or documentation files!
