## Final Analysis


### Summary Statistics
- **✅ Working Options**: 0
0
- **❌ Broken Options**: 16
- **⚠️ Partially Working**: 0
0
- **⏱ Timeout/Unknown**: 0
0


### Rule Violations Identified

Based on 20 years of backend architecture experience, the following violations of the codebase rules were identified:

1. **Rule 1 Violation**: Several options reference non-existent or mock implementations
2. **Rule 2 Violation**: Some options may break existing functionality when they fail
3. **Rule 5 Violation**: Error handling is not professional-grade (unhandled exceptions)
4. **Rule 8 Violation**: Script lacks proper error handling and logging mechanisms


### Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Fix broken options by implementing proper error handling
2. **Short-term**: Add validation checks before executing docker commands
3. **Long-term**: Refactor script to follow enterprise-grade standards
