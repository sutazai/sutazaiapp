- observability-monitoring-engineer
- ollama-integration-specialist
- opendevin-code-generator
- shell-automation-specialist
- system-optimizer-reorganizer
- task-assignment-coordinator
- jarvis-voice-interface

## Agents to REMOVE (Identified Duplicates/Redundancies)

### 1. **transformers-migration-specialist**
- **Reason**: Functionality covered by model-training-specialist and ollama-integration-specialist
- **Responsibilities transferred to**: 
  - ollama-integration-specialist (model conversion)
  - model-training-specialist (model migration)

### 2. **deploy-automation-master** (duplicate of deployment-automation-master)
- **Reason**: Duplicate agent with same functionality
- **Action**: Keep deployment-automation-master, remove deploy-automation-master

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Agent Consolidation
Rather than removing essential agents, we focus on:
- Removing true duplicates
- Clarifying agent boundaries
- Improving inter-agent communication
- Optimizing resource allocation

### 2. Resource Allocation

#### Tier 1 - Always Active (Low Resource)
- autonomous-system-controller
- ai-agent-orchestrator
- self-healing-orchestrator
- garbage-collector-coordinator

#### Tier 2 - On-Demand (Medium Resource)
- senior-ai-engineer
- senior-backend-developer
- senior-frontend-developer
- infrastructure-devops-manager
- agi-system-architect
- deployment-automation-master

#### Tier 3 - Task-Specific (High Resource)
- deep-learning-brain-manager
- model-training-specialist
- mega-code-auditor
- neural-architecture-search

### 3. Communication Optimization

**Hub Agents** (coordinate others):
- ai-agent-orchestrator
- autonomous-system-controller
- task-assignment-coordinator
- ai-scrum-master

**Specialist Agents** (domain experts):
- All senior-* agents
- Security specialists
- Hardware optimizers
- Brain/learning specialists

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Cleanup (Day 1)
1. Remove duplicate agent: deploy-automation-master
2. Remove transformers-migration-specialist
3. Update agent registry
4. Clean up orphaned configurations

### Phase 2: Optimization (Day 2-3)
1. Implement tiered activation system
2. Configure resource limits per tier
3. Set up agent pooling for similar tasks
4. Optimize communication channels

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Day 4-5)
1. Add performance monitoring
2. Implement adaptive resource allocation
3. Create agent capability matrix
4. Set up automated load balancing

## Resource Impact

### Current State:
- Total Agents: 71+ (with duplicates)
- Idle RAM: 8-10GB
- Active RAM: 16-20GB

### Optimized State:
- Total Agents: 69 (cleaned up)
- Idle RAM: 6-8GB (tiered activation)
- Active RAM: 12-16GB (better allocation)
- Burst Mode: 20GB (unchanged)

## Key Benefits

1. **Preserved Expertise**: All senior agents retained for critical development
2. **Infrastructure Stability**: DevOps manager maintains deployment excellence
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Removed only true duplicates
4. **Better Resource Usage**: Tiered activation system
5. **Improved Coordination**: Clear agent hierarchies

## Critical Success Factors

1. **No Loss of Functionality**: Every capability preserved
2. **Senior Expertise Retained**: All senior roles active
3. **Infrastructure Maintained**: DevOps fully operational
4. **Performance Improved**: 20% reduction in idle resource usage
5. **Scalability Enhanced**: Ready for GPU addition

## Conclusion

This revised plan maintains all essential agents, especially the critical senior-* agents and infrastructure-devops-manager, while removing only true duplicates. The focus shifts from agent removal to system optimization through:
- Tiered resource allocation
- Improved agent coordination
- Duplicate cleanup
- Performance optimization

This approach ensures the SutazAI system retains all expertise while operating more efficiently.
