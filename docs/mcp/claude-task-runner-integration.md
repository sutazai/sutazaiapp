# Claude Task Runner MCP Server Integration Report

## Summary
Successfully integrated the **claude-task-runner** MCP server into the SutazAI platform. The investigation also revealed that **claude-squad** is NOT an MCP server but rather a terminal UI for managing AI sessions.

## Investigation Results

### ✅ Claude Task Runner (https://github.com/grahama1970/claude-task-runner)
- **Type**: Python-based MCP server using fastmcp
- **Purpose**: Manages context isolation and focused task execution with Claude
- **Status**: Successfully integrated and tested

### ❌ Claude Squad (https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad)
- **Type**: Go-based terminal UI application
- **Purpose**: Manages multiple AI sessions (Claude Code, Aider, etc.) using tmux
- **Status**: Not an MCP server - no integration performed

```

### Configuration Changes

#### 1. `.mcp.json`
Added entry for claude-task-runner:
```json
"claude-task-runner": {
  "command": "/opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/mcp/wrappers/claude-task-runner.sh",
  "args": [],
  "type": "stdio"
}
```

#### 2. Service Mesh Integration
- Assigned port: **11117**
- Updated: `/opt/sutazaiapp/backend/app/mesh/mcp_mesh_initializer.py`

#### 3. Selfcheck Validation
- Added to: `/opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/mcp/selfcheck_all.sh`
- Status: ✅ Passing

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
The claude-task-runner requires the following Python packages:
- fastmcp (>=2.3.3)
- mcp
- loguru
- litellm (>=1.68.2)
- json-repair (>=0.44.1)
- python-dotenv (>=1.1.0)

### Virtual Environment
A dedicated virtual environment was created at:
`/opt/sutazaiapp/mcp-servers/claude-task-runner/venv/`

### Wrapper Script Features
- Automatic virtual environment detection and activation
- Python path management
- Health check and selfcheck functionality
- Process management (start/stop/restart)
- Compatible with service mesh architecture

## Testing Results

### Selfcheck Validation
```bash
$ /opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/mcp/wrappers/claude-task-runner.sh selfcheck
Performing selfcheck for claude-task-runner...
WARNING: mcp package not installed globally
Installing required packages locally...
✓ claude-task-runner selfcheck passed
```

### Comprehensive MCP Selfcheck
```bash
$ /opt/sutazaiapp/scripts/mcp/selfcheck_all.sh
[OK] claude-task-runner selfcheck passed
```

## MCP Server Capabilities

The claude-task-runner MCP server provides:
1. **Task Isolation**: Execute tasks in isolated contexts
2. **Context Management**: Maintain separate contexts for different tasks
3. **Claude Integration**: Optimized for Claude AI interactions
4. **Result Tracking**: Track task execution and results
5. **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for task execution

## Future Considerations

1. **Production Deployment**: Consider using system-wide Python packages or containerization
2. **Resource Management**: Monitor resource usage as task volume increases
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
4. **Logging**: Set up centralized logging for task execution tracking
5. **Security**: Review and harden Python execution environment

## Conclusion

The claude-task-runner MCP server has been successfully integrated into the SutazAI platform. It is now available for use through the MCP protocol and is fully integrated with the service mesh architecture. The server passed all validation checks and is ready for use.

Claude-squad was determined to be a terminal UI tool for managing AI sessions rather than an MCP server, and therefore was not integrated.
