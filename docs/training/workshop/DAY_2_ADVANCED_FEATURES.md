    def health_check(self):
        response = requests.get(f"{self.base_url}/health")
        return response.json()
    
    def chat(self, message, model="tinyllama", temperature=0.7):
        data = {
            "message": message,
            "model": model,
            "temperature": temperature
        }
        response = requests.post(f"{self.base_url}/chat", json=data)
        return response.json()
    
    def upload_document(self, file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
            files = {'file': f}
            response = requests.post(f"{self.base_url}/documents/upload", files=files)
        return response.json()

        if filename.endswith(('.txt', '.md', '.pdf')):
            file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
            
            # Upload document
            upload_result = client.upload_document(file_path)
            
            # Analyze document
            analysis = client.chat(f"Summarize the document {filename}")
            
            results[filename] = {
                'upload_status': upload_result,
                'summary': analysis['response']
            }
    
    return results

        # Extract email content
        email_content = extract_email_text(email_file)
        
        # Analyze with JARVIS
        analysis = client.chat(f"""
        Analyze this email and provide:
