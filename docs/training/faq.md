## General Questions

### What is SutazAI?

**A**: SutazAI is a comprehensive local AI task automation system that provides intelligent automation for software development, DevOps, security, and operations teams. It features 34+ specialized AI agents that work independently or together to handle tasks like code review, security scanning, test generation, deployment automation, and documentation management—all while keeping your data completely local and private.

### How is SutazAI different from cloud-based AI services?

**A**: Key differences include:

- **Complete Privacy**: All processing happens on your infrastructure—your data never leaves your system
- **No External Dependencies**: Runs entirely offline without requiring internet connectivity
- **Cost-Effective**: No ongoing API fees or subscription costs after initial setup
- **Customizable**: Full control over AI models, configurations, and workflows
- **Compliance-Ready**: Meets strict data residency and privacy requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2)

### What tasks can SutazAI automate?

**A**: SutazAI can automate a wide range of tasks including:

- **Development**: Code review, refactoring, test generation, debugging assistance
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, compliance checking
- **DevOps**: Deployment automation, infrastructure monitoring, performance optimization
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing, test maintenance, quality metrics
- **Documentation**: Technical writing, API documentation, knowledge management
- **Data Analysis**: Private data analysis, ML model training, research assistance

### Is SutazAI suitable for small teams?

**A**: Yes! SutazAI is designed to scale from individual developers to large enterprises. Small teams particularly benefit from:

- **Force Multiplication**: One developer can handle tasks that typically require specialized expertise
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Full-stack applications can be generated in hours rather than weeks
- **Reduced Hiring Needs**: Less need for specialists in every area (DevOps, security, QA)
- **Learning Acceleration**: Built-in best practices and guidance help teams improve skills

## Installation and Setup

### How do I install SutazAI?

**A**: Installation is designed to be simple with a single command:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/sutazai.git
cd sutazai

# Start the system (one command!)
./deploy.sh --environment development

# System will be available at:
# - API: http://localhost:8000/docs
# - Health: http://localhost:8000/health
# - Monitoring: http://localhost:3000
```

The system automatically handles Docker image pulling, service orchestration, and health validation.

### What's included in the default installation?

**A**: The default installation includes:
- 34+ specialized AI agents
- TinyLlama AI model (637MB, optimized for CPU-only operation)
- Ollama model server for local AI inference
- Complete monitoring and health checking system
- API gateway with OpenAPI documentation
- Example workflows and integration templates

### Can I install SutazAI without Docker?

**A**: While Docker is the recommended deployment method for consistency and ease of use, SutazAI can run natively. However, this requires:
- Manual dependency management for each agent
- Individual service configuration and orchestration
- Custom networking and service discovery setup

We strongly recommend using Docker for all but the most specialized deployments.

### How long does installation take?

**A**: Installation times vary by environment:
- **Development (local)**: 10-15 minutes
- **Production (single server)**: 20-30 minutes
- **Production (cluster)**: 45-60 minutes

Most time is spent downloading Docker images and AI models on first run.

## Agent Management

### How do I see which agents are running?

**A**: Several ways to check agent status:

```bash
# Quick status check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Detailed agent list
curl http://localhost:8000/agents/list

# Container status
docker-compose ps

# Monitoring dashboard
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Can I disable agents I don't need?

**A**: Yes, you can customize which agents run:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml, comment out unwanted services
services:
  # senior-ai-engineer:  # Disabled
  #   build: ./agents/senior-ai-engineer
  
  code-generation-improver:  # Enabled
    build: ./agents/code-generation-improver
```

Or use selective deployment:
```bash
./deploy.sh --agents "code-generation-improver,testing-qa-validator,security-pentesting-specialist"
```

### How do I add custom agents?

**A**: Create custom agents using the standard template:

```bash
# Create new agent directory
mkdir -p agents/my-custom-agent

# Use agent template
cp -r agents/_template/* agents/my-custom-agent/

# Implement your agent logic
vim agents/my-custom-agent/app.py

# Add to docker-compose.yml
vim docker-compose.yml

# Deploy
docker-compose up -d my-custom-agent
```

### How do agents communicate with each other?

**A**: Agent communication uses several patterns:
- **Direct HTTP**: Agents call each other's REST APIs
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous communication via Redis/RabbitMQ
- **Orchestrator**: Central coordination through the task orchestrator
- **Shared Storage**: Common data exchange via shared volumes or databases

### Can agents work together on complex tasks?

**A**: Yes, SutazAI supports sophisticated multi-agent workflows:

```python
# Example workflow: Code review with security scan
workflow = {
    "steps": [
        {"agent": "code-generation-improver", "action": "analyze"},
        {"agent": "security-pentesting-specialist", "action": "scan"},
        {"agent": "testing-qa-validator", "action": "generate_tests"}
    ],
    "coordination": "sequential",
    "failure_handling": "rollback"
}
```

## Performance and Scaling

### How many concurrent tasks can SutazAI handle?

**A**: Performance depends on your hardware:
- **Single Server (16GB RAM)**: 20-50 concurrent tasks
- **Multi-Server Cluster**: 100-500+ concurrent tasks
- **Task Complexity**: Simple tasks (higher concurrency) vs complex analysis (lower concurrency)

Monitor via the dashboard and scale based on your actual usage patterns.

### How do I scale SutazAI for higher loads?

**A**: Several scaling strategies:

**Vertical Scaling** (single server):
```bash
# Increase agent instances
docker-compose up --scale senior-ai-engineer=3

# Allocate more resources
export AGENT_MEMORY_LIMIT=4Gi
export AGENT_CPU_LIMIT=2000m
```

**Horizontal Scaling** (multiple servers):
```bash
# Deploy additional nodes
./deploy.sh --environment production --nodes 3

# Use load balancer
./scripts/setup-load-balancer.sh
```

### What's the typical response time for agents?

**A**: Response times vary by task complexity:
- **Simple Analysis**: 2-5 seconds
- **Code Review**: 10-30 seconds
- **Security Scan**: 1-5 minutes
- **Full Application Generation**: 10-60 minutes

These times assume adequate hardware resources and optimized configurations.

### How do I optimize performance?

**A**: Performance optimization strategies:

```bash
# Enable caching
./scripts/enable-caching.sh

# Optimize resource allocation
./scripts/performance-optimization.py

# Use SSD storage for better I/O
mount -o noatime /dev/ssd /opt/sutazaiapp
