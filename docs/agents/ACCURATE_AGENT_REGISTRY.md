## Service Integration Examples

### System Management
```python
# Resource monitoring
from system.services import ResourceMonitor
monitor = ResourceMonitor()
metrics = monitor.get_system_metrics()

# Process management
from system.services import ProcessManager
manager = ProcessManager()
manager.start_service('api-service')

# Security scanning
from security.scanner import CodeScanner
scanner = CodeScanner()
results = scanner.scan_directory('./src')
```

### Task Automation
```python
# Task execution
from automation.tasks import TaskExecutor
executor = TaskExecutor()
result = executor.run_task('data-processing')

# Service coordination
from automation.services import ServiceOrchestrator
orchestrator = ServiceOrchestrator()
orchestrator.coordinate_services(['api', 'ui'])
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent Selection Strategy

### Use OPUS agents when you need:
- Strategic planning and architecture
- Complex problem solving
- Creative solutions
- System-wide optimization
- Leadership and high-level design

### Use SONNET agents when you need:
- Specific tool usage
- Routine automation
- Defined workflows
- Integration tasks
- Specialized analysis
