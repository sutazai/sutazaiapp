## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Decision Engine**: Generates autonomous decisions based on rules and patterns
2. **Health Monitor**: Continuously monitors system health and detects anomalies
3. **Resource Manager**: Manages and allocates system resources
4. **Learning Engine**: Analyzes patterns and improves strategies
5. **Safety Controller**: Ensures all operations are safe
6. **Strategic Planner**: Plans for long-term system evolution

### Control Loops

The controller runs multiple asynchronous control loops:

- **Monitoring Loop** (5s interval): Collects metrics and detects anomalies
- **Decision Loop** (10s interval): Makes autonomous decisions
- **Optimization Loop** (5min interval): Runs optimization strategies
- **Learning Loop** (1min interval): Analyzes patterns and learns
- **Safety Check Loop** (5s interval): Validates safety constraints
- **Checkpoint Loop** (5min interval): Saves system state

- **Predictive Scaling**: Scale based on predicted load

### 3. Error Recovery
- Agent failure recovery
- Service timeout handling
- Data corruption recovery
- Network partition resolution

### 4. Optimization

## Learning Patterns

The controller learns from:

1. **Decision Outcomes**: Tracks success/failure of decisions
2. **Performance Metrics**: Correlates actions with performance changes
3. **Resource Utilization**: Learns optimal resource allocation
4. **Error Patterns**: Identifies recurring issues
5. **Workload Patterns**: Adapts to usage patterns

## Safety Mechanisms

### Constraint Validation
- All decisions validated against safety constraints
- Prevents dangerous operations
- Limits maximum changes

### Rollback Plans
- Every decision has a rollback plan
- Automatic rollback on failure
- State preservation for recovery

### Emergency Protocols
- Predefined emergency response procedures
- Automatic trigger on critical conditions
- Human notification for major events

### Audit Trail
- Complete log of all decisions
- Reasoning and confidence levels
- Outcomes and impacts
- Manual overrides tracked

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collected
- System metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application metrics (response time, throughput, error rate)
- Agent metrics (active count, health status)
- Decision metrics (count, success rate, impact)

### Anomaly Detection
