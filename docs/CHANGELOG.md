## 2025-08-09

### SYSTEM STATUS ACCURACY CORRECTION (v76.1)
- docs(CLAUDE.md): **CRITICAL CORRECTION** - Updated system status to reflect true operational state
  - Container count: Corrected from 14 to 28 containers (all healthy and operational)
  - Backend service: Status corrected from "not running" to "✅ HEALTHY" on port 10010
  - Frontend service: Status corrected from "not running" to "✅ OPERATIONAL" on port 10011
  - Security status: Updated from 78% to 82% secure (23/28 containers non-root, not 11/14)
  - Agent services: All 7 agent services confirmed operational (not mixed reality)
  - System readiness: Upgraded from 87/100 to 95/100 (Production Ready - All Services Operational)
  - Agent: ULTRA-THINKING SYSTEM ARCHITECT
  - Status: **DOCUMENTATION ACCURACY CRITICAL**
  - Impact: CLAUDE.md now reflects true system capabilities for all future development

[2025-08-09 23:48 UTC] - [v76.1] - [Documentation] - [Critical Correction] - Fixed all false system status claims in CLAUDE.md; corrected container counts, service statuses, and security metrics to reflect actual system state. Agent: Ultra-Thinking System Architect. Impact: Eliminates false information that was causing incorrect development decisions; enables accurate system assessment.

### CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Code Injection Vulnerability (v67.10)
- security(langchain-agents): **CRITICAL** - Fixed code injection vulnerability in calculator tool
  - File: `/opt/sutazaiapp/docker/langchain-agents/langchain_agent_server.py:55`
  - Vulnerability: `eval()` function allowing arbitrary Python code execution
  - Impact: Remote code execution, complete system compromise potential
  - Fix: Replaced `eval()` with secure AST parser (`safe_calculate()` function)
  - Security validation: All injection attempts now properly blocked
  - Agent: SYSTEM ARCHITECT - SEC-CRITICAL-001
  - Status: **PRODUCTION CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED**

### Docker Health Check Standardization (v67.9)
- fix(docker): Fixed hardware-resource-optimizer health check port mismatch
  - docker-compose.yml: hardware-resource-optimizer health check changed from `*backend_health_test` (port 8000) to `["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]` (correct port 8080)
  - Issue: Service showed "unhealthy" despite working correctly due to health check testing wrong port
  - Verification: All other agent services already use correct health check patterns for their respective ports

[2025-08-09 16:57 UTC] - [v67.9] - [Docker Infrastructure] - [Fix] - Corrected health check port mismatch for hardware-resource-optimizer service; standardized health checks across agent services. Agent: Infrastructure DevOps Manager (Claude Code). Impact: Service will now correctly report healthy status; no behavior change to service functionality. Dependency: Requires container recreation for health check to take effect.

### Monitoring Scripts (v67.8)
- fix(monitoring): Align live monitor connectivity checks with actual service ports
  - scripts/monitoring/live_logs.sh: API Connectivity now derives backend/frontend ports via `docker port` with fallbacks (backend 10010, frontend 10011); endpoint tester updated accordingly.

[2025-08-09 14:20] - [v67.8] - [Monitoring] - [Fix] - Corrected hardcoded ports (8000/8501) to dynamic discovery for accurate status when backend is healthy on 10010 and frontend on 10011. Agent: Coding Agent (DevOps specialist). Impact: Dashboard no longer reports false negatives; no behavior change to services.

### Security Hardening (v67.7)
- security(config): Removed hardcoded database/password defaults from backend settings
  - backend/app/core/config.py: POSTGRES_PASSWORD, NEO4J_PASSWORD, GRAFANA_PASSWORD no longer default to insecure values; validators enforce strong secrets in staging/production
  - backend/core/config.py: POSTGRES_PASSWORD default removed
  - backend/app/core/connection_pool.py: eliminated hardcoded fallback secret; env required

[2025-08-09 13:40 UTC] - [v67.7] - [Backend Config] - [Security] - Eliminated hardcoded password fallbacks; env-driven secrets enforced with validators. Agent: Coding Agent (backend specialist). Impact: strengthens secret handling; compose supplies required envs. Dependency: Local DB paths need `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` when DB access is used.

### Architecture Hygiene (v67.7)
- refactor(config): Centralized settings to single source in `backend/app/core/config.py`
  - Added backward-compatible shim at `backend/core/config.py` to re-export `AppSettings`, `get_settings`, `settings`
- fix(defaults): Aligned connection defaults with docker-compose service names
  - Defaults now: `postgres`, `redis`, `http://ollama:11434`

[2025-08-09 13:48 UTC] - [v67.7] - [Backend] - [Refactor] - Config shim added; defaults aligned with compose. Agent: Coding Agent (system + backend + API architects). Impact: reduces duplication and misconfig risk; no behavior change for compose deployments.

### Agent Orchestrator Consolidation (v67.7)
- refactor(agents): Centralized orchestrator logic to `app/services/agent_orchestrator.py`
  - `app/agent_orchestrator.py` now re-exports the canonical orchestrator (compatibility shim)
  - Left `app/orchestration/agent_orchestrator.py` intact (distinct workflow engine) to avoid removing advanced functionality
- deps(backend): Rationalized minimal requirements
  - `backend/requirements-minimal.txt` now includes `-r requirements_minimal.txt` (single canonical minimal spec)
