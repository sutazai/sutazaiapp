- Why it was changed: Import analysis flagged syntax errors causing parsing failures; corrections reduce noise and prevent runtime errors.
- Potential impact: No functional change to service behavior; safer imports and cleaner analysis.

## [2025-08-07 21:12 UTC] - [v60] - [Governance] - [Docs] - [Adopt Comprehensive Codebase Rules] - Author: AI Agent (Codex CLI)
- What was changed: Reviewed and aligned workflow with “COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES” (2024-12-19).
  - Confirmed existing pre-commit hooks enforce Rules 1, 2, 6–8, 10–11, 15–16 (fantasy blocks, breaking-change checks, doc/script structure, Docker linting, LLM usage via Ollama).
  - Noted next actions: env-gated advanced routers (preserve defaults), add skip guards for external-service tests, continue duplicate/requirements consolidation with backups.
- Why it was changed: Establish mandatory hygiene and regression prevention standards across the repo.
- Potential impact: Stronger guardrails; no immediate runtime changes.

## [2025-08-07 21:15 UTC] - [v60] - [Backend] - [Enhancement] - [Env-gated feature flags for routers] - Author: AI Agent (Codex CLI)

  - Replaced eager `__import__` checks with `importlib.util.find_spec` (lightweight) and returned status instead of raising.
  - Removed automatic requirement check on import; added explicit, lazy `check_requirements()` that callers can invoke when needed.
- Why it was changed: Reduce import-time overhead and improve startup/test performance, especially when fusion features are unused.
- Potential impact: None to existing functionality; consumers that relied on import-time exceptions should call `check_requirements()` explicitly.
