# üßº SutazAI Codebase Hygiene Guide

## Overview

This guide establishes the fundamental principles and practices for maintaining exceptional codebase hygiene across the SutazAI multi-agent platform. Clean, consistent, and organized code is non-negotiable and reflects engineering discipline that enables scalability, team velocity, and fault tolerance.

Every contributor and AI agent is accountable for maintaining and improving hygiene‚Äînot just avoiding harm.

## Core Hygiene Principles

### üß± Clean Code Standards

#### Self-Documenting Code
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names that explain purpose
- Write code that reads like well-structured prose
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Choose meaningful abstractions that reflect business domain

#### Consistent Formatting
- Mandatory use of automated formatters:
  - **Python**: Black, isort
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Prettier, ESLint
  - **Go**: gofmt, goimports
  - **Rust**: rustfmt
- Configure IDE/editor to format on save
- Enforce consistent indentation (spaces vs tabs) project-wide

#### Robust Error Handling
- Implement specific exception types for different error conditions
- Provide clear error messages with actionable information
- Build recovery strategies where appropriate
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging

#### Documentation Standards
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Document complex business logic with inline comments
- Maintain comprehensive docstrings for public APIs
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes

### üö´ Zero Duplication Policy

#### Code Deduplication
- **NEVER duplicate functionality** across modules, services, or components
- Extract common patterns into shared utilities and libraries
- Consolidate similar logic before it proliferates
- Use composition and inheritance appropriately to reduce duplication

#### Configuration Unification
- Maintain single source of truth for configuration
- Avoid scattered config files with conflicting values
- Use environment-specific overrides rather than duplicate configs
- Centralize feature flags and runtime parameters

#### Documentation Consolidation
- Keep documentation in designated locations
- Avoid multiple README files with overlapping content
- Maintain single authoritative guides per topic
- Cross-reference related documentation appropriately

### üìÇ File Organization Standards

#### Directory Structure Discipline
```
/opt/sutazaiapp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/                     # Agent implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/                    # API and core services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/                   # User interface components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/                     # Configuration files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                       # Documentation hub
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                    # Automation and tooling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitoring/                 # Observability setup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                      # Test suites
```

#### Placement Guidelines
- **Never dump files** in random or top-level directories
- Place files intentionally following modular boundaries:
  - `components/` for reusable UI parts
  - `services/` for network interactions and business logic
  - `utils/` for pure functions and helpers
  - `hooks/` for reusable frontend state logic
  - `schemas/` for data validation and types
  - `tests/` for test files co-located with source

#### Naming Conventions
- Use consistent naming patterns across all file types
- Follow language-specific conventions (snake_case for Python, camelCase for JavaScript)
- Use descriptive names that indicate file purpose
- Avoid abbreviations and cryptic naming

### üóëÔ∏è Dead Code Elimination

#### Proactive Cleanup
- Regularly identify and remove unused code, imports, and dependencies
- Delete legacy assets and experimental stubs immediately when obsolete
- Remove commented-out code blocks (use version control for history)
- Eliminate temporary test files and debug artifacts

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ‚ùå "Just in case" or "might be useful later" justifications
- ‚ùå Keeping dead code "for reference"
- ‚ùå Accumulating temporary or experimental files
- ‚ùå Leaving TODO comments without action plans

### üõ†Ô∏è Automated Tool Integration

#### Mandatory Tooling
- **Linters**: ESLint, Flake8, RuboCop, clippy
- **Formatters**: Prettier, Black, gofmt, rustfmt
- **Static Analysis**: TypeScript, mypy, SonarQube, Bandit
- **Dependency Management**: pip-tools, Poetry, pnpm, Cargo
- **Schema Validation**: JSON Schema, Pydantic, Zod
- **Test Coverage**: Jest, pytest-cov, Istanbul, tarpaulin

#### CI/CD Integration
- Pre-commit hooks enforce hygiene checks
- Pull request gates require passing all quality checks
- Automated code review and suggestion systems
- Continuous dependency security scanning

## Agent-Specific Guidelines

### Hygiene Responsibilities by Agent Type

#### Document Knowledge Manager
- Maintains clean document processing pipelines
- Ensures semantic chunking follows consistent patterns
- Keeps knowledge graphs optimized and deduplicated
- Implements proper error handling for document parsing

#### Context Optimization Engineer
- Optimizes prompt templates for clarity and efficiency
- Maintains consistent context formatting across agents
- Eliminates redundant context patterns
- Ensures context switching is clean and traceable

#### Testing QA Validator
- Enforces test code hygiene standards
- Maintains comprehensive test coverage
- Ensures test isolation and determinism
- Keeps test data clean and representative

#### Security Pentesting Specialist
- Maintains clean security scanning configurations
- Ensures consistent vulnerability reporting formats
- Keeps security policies up-to-date and consolidated
- Implements proper secrets management hygiene

### Cross-Agent Coordination
- Agents coordinate to avoid overlapping cleanup efforts
- Shared utilities are maintained collaboratively
- Configuration changes are propagated consistently
- Documentation updates are synchronized across agents

## Professional Standards

### Code Review Excellence
- Review for hygiene compliance before functionality
- Require clean, self-explaining code changes
- Enforce documentation updates with code changes
- Maintain high standards for commit message quality

### Commit Discipline
- Write atomic commits with single logical changes
- Follow conventional commit patterns (feat:, fix:, refactor:)
- Include meaningful commit messages explaining "why"
- Never skip reviews for "quick fixes"

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular hygiene audits and improvement initiatives
- Proactive technical debt identification and resolution
- Knowledge sharing of hygiene best practices
- Tool evaluation and adoption for better hygiene

## Red Flags and Anti-Patterns

### Critical Violations
üî¥ **"I'll just put this here for now"** - No temporary placements
üî¥ **"It's just a tiny change"** - All changes matter for hygiene
üî¥ **"We can clean this up later"** - "Later" never comes
üî¥ **Multiple utils modules** - Consolidate common functionality
üî¥ **Mixed concerns in single files** - Maintain separation of concerns

### Warning Signs
‚ö†Ô∏è Increasing build times due to dependency bloat
‚ö†Ô∏è Growing number of similar-looking files
‚ö†Ô∏è Difficulty finding specific functionality
‚ö†Ô∏è Frequent merge conflicts in configuration files
‚ö†Ô∏è Test flakiness due to poor isolation

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Measures
- Code duplication percentage (target: < 3%)
- Test coverage (target: > 90%)
- Static analysis violations (target: 0 critical)
- Build time trends (target: stable or decreasing)
- Documentation coverage (target: 100% public APIs)

### Qualitative Indicators
- New team members can navigate codebase easily
- Features can be developed without extensive refactoring
- Bug fixes are localized and don't cascade
- Code review feedback focuses on logic, not style
- Technical debt backlog remains manageable

## Conclusion

Codebase hygiene is a shared responsibility that requires constant vigilance and discipline. Every line of code should leave the codebase better than it was found. By following these principles and leveraging our AI agents for enforcement, we maintain a world-class development environment that scales with our ambitions.

**Remember**: A healthy codebase is not just clean code‚Äîit's code that empowers every contributor to build amazing things efficiently and confidently.
