## [Unreleased]

## 2025-08-18 15:25:00 UTC - Service Mesh Investigation Complete
- **Who**: Senior Distributed Computing Architect
- **What**: Complete investigation of service mesh architecture and failures
- **Why**: Service mesh non-functional, Consul shows CRITICAL, Kong routes broken
- **Impact**: Identified fundamental architectural impossibility with DinD isolation
- **Files Created**: 
  - SERVICE_MESH_INVESTIGATION_COMPLETE.md - Complete analysis and recommendations
- **Key Findings**:
  - DinD network isolation prevents service mesh integration
  - 19 MCP containers unreachable from host services
  - Consul registrations point to non-existent endpoints
  - Kong routes fail due to network isolation
  - Backend API connection refused (service down)
- **Recommendation**: Complete architectural redesign required
- **Scripts Created**:
  - /scripts/mesh/fix_service_mesh_complete.py - Comprehensive fix attempt
  - /scripts/mesh/direct_mesh_fix.py - Direct network bridge attempt
- **Test Results**: 0/19 MCP services accessible, 0% connectivity achieved

## 2024-08-09 - Initial Creation
- Created initial architecture documentation structure
- Added system overview and component diagrams
- Defined technology stack and scalability design
