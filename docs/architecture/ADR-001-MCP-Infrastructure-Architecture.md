# ADR-001: MCP Infrastructure Architecture

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-08-16  
**Deciders:** System Architecture Team  
**Technical Story:** Critical MCP infrastructure remediation

---

## Context

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) infrastructure was experiencing total failure with API endpoints returning 404/empty responses despite having 21 configured MCP servers. This ADR documents the architectural decisions made to remediate the system and establish a robust, scalable MCP integration.

### Problem Statement
1. **Complete Integration Failure:** All `/api/v1/mcp/*` endpoints non-functional
2. **Infrastructure Paradox:** Well-designed components exist but aren't connected
3. **Protocol Gap:** No working STDIO ↔ HTTP translation
4. **Multi-Client Limitation:** No support for concurrent client access
5. **Monitoring Blindness:** No visibility into MCP service health

### Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Cause:** Import path bug in `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/mcp.py`
- Used `....mesh` (4 dots) instead of `...mesh` (3 dots)
- Caused fallback to broken `SimpleMCPBridge` placeholder
- Bypassed all sophisticated bridge infrastructure

**Secondary Causes:**
- Complex initialization chains with unclear failure modes
- Missing protocol translation layer activation
- No service discovery integration
- Insufficient error handling and diagnostics

---

## Decision

We have decided to implement a **layered, microservices-oriented MCP architecture** with the following key decisions:

### 1. Docker-in-Docker (DinD) Orchestration
**Decision:** Use DinD as the primary MCP service orchestration platform

**Rationale:**
- Provides complete process isolation between MCP services
- Enables safe multi-client access without interference
- Allows independent scaling and resource management
- Supports hot-swapping of MCP services without affecting others

**Implementation:**
- `sutazai-mcp-orchestrator`: Docker-in-Docker runtime
- `sutazai-mcp-manager`: Management and monitoring interface
- Port allocation: 11100-11199 for MCP services
- Internal networking with bridge isolation

### 2. Multi-Layer Bridge Architecture
**Decision:** Implement hierarchical bridge selection with fallback strategy

**Rationale:**
- Provides resilience through multiple integration paths
- Allows gradual migration from legacy to advanced bridges
- Enables different optimization strategies per use case

**Architecture:**
```
Priority 1: DinDMeshBridge    (Multi-client, isolated)
Priority 2: MCPStdioBridge   (Direct, fast)
Priority 3: MCPContainerBridge (Containerized)
Fallback:   Informative error (No silent failures)
```

### 3. Protocol Translation Layer
**Decision:** Implement comprehensive STDIO ↔ HTTP protocol translation

**Rationale:**
- MCP services use STDIO (JSON-RPC) but clients expect HTTP/REST
- Need bidirectional translation with proper error handling
- Must preserve request/response semantics and metadata

**Implementation:**
- `MCPProtocolTranslator`: Core translation engine
- Request/Response mapping with proper error propagation
- Support for streaming and async operations
- Comprehensive logging and metrics

### 4. Service Mesh Integration
**Decision:** Integrate MCP services with existing Consul/Kong service mesh

**Rationale:**
- Leverages existing infrastructure for service discovery
- Provides load balancing and health checking
- Enables proper request routing and monitoring
- Supports service governance and security policies

**Integration Points:**
- Consul: Service registration and discovery
- Kong: API gateway and rate limiting
- Prometheus: Metrics collection
- Jaeger: Distributed tracing

### 5. Multi-Client Session Management
**Decision:** Implement client-aware session management with resource isolation

**Rationale:**
- Support concurrent access from multiple AI systems
- Prevent client interference and resource contention
- Enable client-specific configuration and quotas
- Support different service tiers (free, pro, enterprise)

**Features:**
- JWT-based client authentication
- Session-scoped resource quotas
- Priority-based request queuing
- Per-client metrics and monitoring

### 6. Port Allocation Strategy
**Decision:** Use deterministic port allocation for MCP services

**Rationale:**
- Provides predictable service discovery
- Simplifies networking and firewall configuration
- Enables easy service identification and debugging

**Allocation:**
```
Base Port: 11100
Range: 11100-11199 (100 services max)
Allocation: Sequential by service name
Example: files=11100, postgres=11101, github=11102
```

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Direct STDIO Integration
**Rejected because:**
- No process isolation between clients
- Difficult to scale horizontally
- Limited monitoring and control capabilities
- Single point of failure

### Alternative 2: HTTP-Only MCP Services
**Rejected because:**
- Requires modifying all existing MCP implementations
- Breaks compatibility with standard MCP protocol
- Increases implementation complexity for MCP developers
- Lost ecosystem benefits

### Alternative 3: Single Monolithic Bridge
**Rejected because:**
- Creates single point of failure
- Difficult to optimize for different use cases
- Hard to test and debug individual components
- Limits future extensibility

### Alternative 4: External MCP Gateway
**Rejected because:**
- Adds another external dependency
- Increases architectural complexity
- May not integrate well with existing infrastructure
- Harder to customize for specific needs
