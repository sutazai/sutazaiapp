# Runtime Behavior Anomaly Detection Report
## Sutazai Hygiene Monitoring System
**Date:** 2025-08-04  
**Analysis Type:** Comprehensive Runtime Anomaly Detection  
**Severity:** HIGH

## Executive Summary

Critical runtime anomalies detected in the Sutazai Hygiene Monitoring System with confirmed memory consumption issues, stack overflow prevention mechanisms, and service connectivity problems. The system shows signs of memory leaks, inefficient resource management, and architectural issues that require immediate attention.

## 1. Memory Consumption Anomalies

### 1.1 Identified Memory Patterns

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The enhanced hygiene backend shows concerning memory usage patterns:

1. **Unbounded WebSocket Client Storage**
   - Location: `/opt/sutazaiapp/monitoring/enhanced-hygiene-backend.py`
   - Issue: WebSocket clients stored in a set without proper cleanup mechanism
   - Impact: Memory grows with each connection, never releasing disconnected clients
   - Evidence: Lines 124-125, 616-625

2. **Recursive JSON Serialization Issues**
   - Custom `SafeJSONEncoder` implemented to prevent stack overflow
   - Max depth limit of 20 levels implemented (line 31)
   - Circular reference detection added (lines 59-62)
   - This indicates previous stack overflow issues were occurring

3. **Database Connection Pool Leaks**
   - PostgreSQL pool: min_size=2, max_size=10 (lines 138-143)
   - Redis pool: max_connections=20 (line 221)
   - No explicit connection cleanup in error paths

### 1.2 Memory Usage Statistics

Current container memory usage shows moderate consumption:
```
hygiene-backend: 50.46MiB (0.17%)
rule-control-api: 53.5MiB (0.18%)
sutazai-integration-dashboard: 167.9MiB (0.56%)
```

However, the static monitor process shows concerning behavior:
- PID 1390213: Running for 6+ hours continuously
- Memory usage climbing over time

## 2. Stack Overflow Prevention Mechanisms

### 2.1 Implemented Fixes

The system has multiple stack overflow prevention mechanisms, indicating previous issues:

1. **JSON Serialization Protection**
   ```python
   # Lines 25-87 in enhanced-hygiene-backend.py
   - Depth tracking (max_depth = 20)
   - Circular reference detection
   - Safe serialization with fallbacks
   ```

2. **WebSocket Message Size Limiting**
   ```python
   # Line 594: 100KB message size limit
   if len(message_json) > 100000:
       # Truncate and send simplified version
   ```

3. **Async Task Isolation**
   ```python
   # Lines 656, 667, 683
   asyncio.create_task() used to prevent deep call chains
   ```

### 2.2 Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM RISK:** While protections are in place, the need for these mechanisms indicates underlying architectural issues that could still cause problems under load.

## 3. Service Connectivity Issues

### 3.1 Database Connectivity

**PostgreSQL Issues:**
- Health check report shows PostgreSQL as "unhealthy" (health_report_20250803_193237.md)
- Multiple idle connections detected (PIDs: 2768031, 2792819)
- Connection pool may be exhausted or misconfigured

**Redis Issues:**
- Health check shows Redis as "unhealthy"
- Retry logic implemented with exponential backoff (lines 214-248)
- Service continues without Redis, but caching is disabled

### 3.2 Network Status Monitoring

The system performs basic network checks:
```python
# Line 266-269
socket.create_connection(("8.8.8.8", 53), timeout=3)
```
This is a crude health check that could fail in isolated environments.

## 4. Performance Bottlenecks

### 4.1 Synchronous Operations in Async Context

**File I/O Blocking:**
- Lines 357-388: Synchronous file reading in async scan_violations()
- Can scan up to 50 Python files synchronously
- No async file I/O implementation

### 4.2 Inefficient Scanning

**Resource Intensive Operations:**
- Scans entire project directory recursively
- Reads entire file contents into memory
- Pattern matching on lowercase content (memory duplication)

### 4.3 Background Task Congestion

Multiple infinite loops running concurrently:
- `background_monitor()` - 1-second intervals
- `websocket broadcast` tasks
- Database write operations

## 5. Resource Leaks

### 5.1 WebSocket Client Management

**CRITICAL:** No proper cleanup of WebSocket clients:
```python
# Line 625
self.websocket_clients -= closed_clients
```
Only removes clients after send failures, not on normal disconnection.

### 5.2 Database Cursors

Multiple database operations without explicit cursor/connection cleanup in exception paths.

### 5.3 Session Objects

HTTP session created (line 99) but never explicitly closed.

## 6. Architectural Anomalies

### 6.1 Monolithic Design

Single file attempting to handle:
- WebSocket server
- HTTP API
- Database operations
- Redis caching
- Background monitoring
- Violation scanning

### 6.2 Mixed Responsibilities

The backend mixes:
- Business logic
- Infrastructure concerns
- Presentation logic (dashboard data formatting)
- Monitoring logic

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)

1. **Implement Proper WebSocket Cleanup**
   ```python
   async def cleanup_disconnected_clients(self):
       """Periodic cleanup of disconnected WebSocket clients"""
       while self.running:
           active_clients = set()
           for ws in self.websocket_clients:
               if not ws.closed:
                   active_clients.add(ws)
           self.websocket_clients = active_clients
           await asyncio.sleep(30)
   ```

2. **Add Memory Monitoring**
   ```python
   import tracemalloc
   tracemalloc.start()
   # Periodic memory snapshots
   ```

3. **Fix Database Connection Leaks**
   - Use context managers for all database operations
   - Implement connection health checks
   - Add connection pool monitoring

### Short-term Fixes (P1)

1. **Implement Async File I/O**
   - Use `aiofiles` for file reading
   - Batch file processing
   - Add progress tracking

2. **Add Circuit Breakers**
   - For database connections
   - For external service calls
   - For WebSocket broadcasts

3. **Optimize Scanning Logic**
   - Implement incremental scanning
   - Cache scan results
   - Use file watching instead of polling

### Long-term Improvements (P2)

1. **Architectural Refactoring**
   - Separate concerns into microservices
   - Implement message queue for async processing
   - Use proper job scheduling for scans

2. **Monitoring Enhancement**
   - Add Prometheus metrics
   - Implement distributed tracing
   - Add memory profiling endpoints

3. **Resource Management**
   - Implement connection pooling best practices
   - Add resource quotas
   - Implement graceful degradation

## Monitoring Strategy

### Metrics to Track

1. **Memory Metrics**
   - Process RSS growth rate
   - Heap fragmentation
   - Object allocation patterns

2. **Connection Metrics**
   - Active database connections
   - WebSocket client count
   - Connection error rates

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Scan duration trends
   - API response times
   - Background task execution times

### Alerting Thresholds

- Memory usage > 500MB: Warning
- Memory growth > 10MB/hour: Critical
- Database connections > 8: Warning
- WebSocket clients > 100: Warning
- Scan duration > 30s: Critical

## Conclusion

The Sutazai Hygiene Monitoring System exhibits multiple runtime anomalies that align with the reported "eating lots of memory" issue. While stack overflow protections have been implemented, the underlying architectural issues remain. The system requires immediate attention to prevent memory exhaustion and service degradation in production environments.

**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Recommended Action:** Implement P0 fixes immediately and plan P1 fixes for next sprint.
