## Overview


## Key Components

### 1. Threat Detector (`threat_detector.py`)

#### Features
- Network Anomaly Detection
- Process Behavior Monitoring
- IP Reputation Checking

#### Threat Detection Mechanisms
- Suspicious Port Monitoring
- High Resource Usage Detection
- Malicious Command Line Identification
- External IP Reputation Verification

### 2. Configuration Management

- Customizable threat sensitivity
- Configurable suspicious port list
- IP blacklisting and whitelisting
- Logging and encryption settings

### 3. Logging and Reporting

- Detailed threat reports
- Performance and resource utilization tracking

## Usage Example

```python

# Initialize threat detector
threat_detector = ThreatDetector(
)

# Run comprehensive threat scan
threats = threat_detector.run_comprehensive_threat_scan()

# Start continuous monitoring
threat_detector.start_continuous_monitoring(interval=30)
```

## Configuration Options


```json
{
    "max_failed_logins": 5,
    "suspicious_ports": [22, 23, 3389],
    "blacklisted_ips": [],
    "whitelisted_ips": [],
    "threat_sensitivity": "medium"
}
```


1. Regularly update the threat detection rules
3. Keep the configuration flexible but restrictive
4. Use strong, unique encryption keys
5. Implement multi-factor authentication

## Dependencies

- `psutil` for system monitoring
- `requests` for external IP reputation checks
- `cryptography` for secure logging
- `logging` for comprehensive event tracking

## Performance Considerations

The threat detection system is designed to be lightweight and non-intrusive, with configurable scan intervals and minimal system overhead.

## Future Roadmap

- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Enhanced network traffic analysis
- More granular process and network monitoring
