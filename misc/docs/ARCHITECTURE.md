# System Architecture Documentation

This document provides an overview of the system architecture for SutazAI.

## Project Structure

- **backend/**: Contains API routing and request handling code (e.g., routers in backend/routers).
- **core_system/**: Includes core functionalities, utilities, and logging modules.
- **docs/**: Documentation for the project (this file and other docs).
- **scripts/**: Operational and deployment scripts.
- **venv/**: Virtual environment for dependency management.

## Key Components

1. **FastAPI Application**:
   - Defines API endpoints in the backend/routers directory.
   - Uses Pydantic models for validation (e.g., SystemStatus model).

2. **Core System Modules**:
   - Implements critical functionalities and system utilities such as logging (e.g., LogManager in core_system/log_manager.py).

## Improvements Made

- Standardized code formatting and adhered to PEP8 guidelines.
- Updated logging techniques to use lazy formatting for performance and clarity.
- Replaced unsupported or deprecated FastAPI functionality (e.g., removed add_exception_handler usage on APIRouter).
- Cleaned up redundant code and improved error handling and validation across modules.
- Added comprehensive documentation and changelog for maintainability.

## Future Enhancements

- Performance profiling and further optimization of critical code paths.
- Integration of automated tests and CI/CD pipelines.
- Further modularization of services and dynamic configuration management.
