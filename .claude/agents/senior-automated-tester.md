This enhanced senior-automated-tester agent now matches the comprehensive pattern established in agent-expert.md with:

1. **Complete 20-rule enforcement system** with testing-specific applications
2. **Comprehensive workflow procedures** with detailed operational steps and timing
3. **Enhanced testing specialization framework** with clear tier classifications
4. **Multi-framework coordination patterns** for complex test execution
5. **Performance optimization framework** with metrics and continuous improvement
6. **Detailed validation criteria** ensuring quality and compliance
7. **Cross-agent validation requirements** for comprehensive quality assurance
8. **Proper CHANGELOG.md integration** with timestamp tracking
9. **Real implementation examples** showing practical test automation frameworks

The agent now provides enterprise-grade test automation capabilities with the same level of sophistication and comprehensiveness as the agent-expert pattern.
