## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "cloud\|infrastructure\|terraform\|aws\|azure\|gcp" . --include="*.md" --include="*.tf" --include="*.yml"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working cloud implementations with existing capabilities
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy Cloud Architecture**
- Every cloud design must use existing, documented cloud services and proven deployment patterns
- All infrastructure as code must work with current Terraform/CloudFormation versions and provider capabilities
- All service integrations must exist and be accessible in target cloud environments
- Cloud resource specifications must be real, tested, and within service limits
- Infrastructure configurations must address actual cost, performance, and security requirements
- Security policies must be implementable with current cloud provider capabilities
- All networking configurations must work with actual VPC/VNet limitations and routing capabilities
- No assumptions about "future" cloud capabilities or planned service enhancements
- Cost estimates must be based on current pricing and actual resource usage patterns
- **VETERAN INSIGHT**: After 20 years, I've learned that "bleeding edge" often means "bleeding budget" - stick to stable, proven services for production workloads

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Functionality - Cloud Infrastructure Safety**
- Before implementing new cloud infrastructure, verify current deployment patterns and dependencies
- All new cloud designs must preserve existing service functionality and integration patterns
- Infrastructure changes must not break existing application deployments or data persistence
- New cloud services must not block legitimate application workflows or existing integrations
- Changes to networking must maintain backward compatibility with existing service communication
- Infrastructure modifications must not alter expected service endpoints or access patterns
- Cloud additions must not impact existing monitoring and alerting configurations
- Rollback procedures must restore exact previous infrastructure without service loss
- All modifications must pass existing infrastructure validation suites before adding new capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines must enhance, not replace, existing deployment validation processes
- **BATTLE-TESTED WISDOM**: The fastest way to destroy trust is to break production on Friday afternoon - always implement changes with surgical precision and comprehensive rollback plans

**Rule 3: Comprehensive Analysis Required - Full Cloud Ecosystem Understanding**
- Analyze complete cloud ecosystem from networking to application layer before implementation
- Map all dependencies including cloud services, third-party integrations, and application requirements
- Review all configuration files for cloud-relevant settings and potential integration conflicts
- Examine all infrastructure schemas and deployment patterns for potential cloud integration requirements
- Investigate all API endpoints and external integrations for cloud networking and security requirements
- Analyze all deployment pipelines and CI/CD for cloud scalability and resource requirements

- Examine all user workflows and business processes affected by cloud infrastructure implementations
- Investigate all compliance requirements and regulatory constraints affecting cloud architecture design
- Analyze all disaster recovery and backup procedures for cloud resilience and data protection
- **20-YEAR INSIGHT**: The most expensive mistakes happen when you optimize one system without understanding its upstream and downstream dependencies - always map the entire ecosystem first

**Rule 4: Investigate Existing Files & Consolidate First - No Cloud Infrastructure Duplication**
- Search exhaustively for existing cloud infrastructure implementations, templates, or configuration patterns
- Consolidate any scattered cloud configurations into centralized infrastructure as code framework
- Investigate purpose of any existing cloud scripts, deployment automation, or infrastructure utilities

- Integrate cloud metrics with existing system performance and cost monitoring dashboards
- Consolidate cloud procedures with existing deployment and operational workflows
- Merge cloud implementations with existing CI/CD validation and approval processes
- Archive and document migration of any existing cloud implementations during consolidation
