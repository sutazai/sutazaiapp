## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "api\|backend\|service\|endpoint" . --include="*.md" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" --include="*.json"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working backend implementations with existing capabilities
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy Backend Architecture**
- Every backend design must use existing, documented frameworks and proven architectural patterns
- All API implementations must work with current infrastructure and available deployment environments
- No theoretical microservices patterns or "placeholder" service capabilities
- All database integrations must exist and be accessible in target deployment environment
- Backend coordination mechanisms must be real, documented, and tested
- API specializations must address actual performance requirements from proven backend capabilities
- Configuration variables must exist in environment or config files with validated schemas
- All backend workflows must resolve to tested patterns with specific performance criteria
- No assumptions about "future" backend capabilities or planned infrastructure enhancements
- Backend performance metrics must be measurable with current monitoring infrastructure

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Functionality - Backend Integration Safety**
- Before implementing new APIs, verify current endpoint workflows and client integration patterns
- All new backend designs must preserve existing API behaviors and client compatibility
- API specialization must not break existing microservice workflows or orchestration pipelines
- New backend tools must not block legitimate API workflows or existing integrations
- Changes to backend coordination must maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
- API modifications must not alter expected input/output formats for existing client processes
- Backend additions must not impact existing logging and metrics collection
- Rollback procedures must restore exact previous backend coordination without client disruption
- All modifications must pass existing API validation suites before adding new capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines must enhance, not replace, existing backend validation processes

**Rule 3: Comprehensive Analysis Required - Full Backend Ecosystem Understanding**
- Analyze complete backend ecosystem from API design to deployment before implementation
- Map all dependencies including backend frameworks, coordination systems, and workflow pipelines
- Review all configuration files for backend-relevant settings and potential coordination conflicts
- Examine all backend schemas and workflow patterns for potential API integration requirements
- Investigate all API endpoints and external integrations for backend coordination opportunities
- Analyze all deployment pipelines and infrastructure for backend scalability and resource requirements
- Review all existing monitoring and alerting for integration with backend observability
- Examine all user workflows and business processes affected by backend implementations
