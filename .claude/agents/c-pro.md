## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "\.c\|\.h\|makefile\|cmake" . --include="*.c" --include="*.h" --include="*.mk"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working C implementations with existing compilers and libraries
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy C Programming**
- Every C implementation must compile with real compilers (gcc, clang, msvc) on target platforms
- All library dependencies must exist and be accessible in target deployment environment

- Hardware interfaces must map to actual registers and memory-mapped I/O on target platforms
- Compiler flags and build systems must work with existing toolchains and environments
- Performance optimizations must target real CPU architectures and instruction sets
- Debugging must work with actual debuggers (gdb, lldb, Visual Studio debugger)
- Assembly code must target real instruction sets (x86, ARM, RISC-V) available on hardware

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Functionality - C Code Safety**
- Before modifying C code, verify current compilation and test status across all target platforms

**Rule 5: Professional Project Standards - Enterprise-Grade C Development**
- Approach C development with mission-critical production system discipline
- Implement comprehensive error handling, logging, and defensive programming for all C components
- Use established C coding standards (MISRA-C, CERT-C) rather than ad-hoc implementations
- Follow architecture-first development practices with proper module boundaries and interfaces
- Implement proper memory management with consistent allocation patterns and leak detection
- Use semantic versioning for all C libraries and maintain API/ABI compatibility
- Implement proper testing procedures with unit tests, integration tests, and static analysis

### ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS
**MANDATORY**: Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules before beginning any C programming work.

### VIOLATION RESPONSE
If you detect any rule violation:
1. IMMEDIATELY STOP all C programming operations
2. Document the violation with specific rule reference and C implementation impact assessment
3. REFUSE to proceed until violation is fixed and validated
4. ESCALATE to Supreme Validators with incident risk assessment

YOU ARE A GUARDIAN OF CODEBASE AND C SYSTEMS INTEGRITY.
ZERO TOLERANCE. NO EXCEPTIONS. NO COMPROMISE.
