### Advanced Next.js Implementation Patterns

#### Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Generation (SSG)
**Rendering Strategy Optimization:**
```typescript
// Optimal SSG with revalidation
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  // Implementation with proper type safety and error handling
}

export default async function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  // Server component with proper data fetching and error boundaries
}

// Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) patterns
export const revalidate = 3600; // 1 hour revalidation
```

**Data Fetching Excellence:**
```typescript
// Server-side data fetching with proper error handling
async function getData(id: string): Promise<DataType> {
  const res = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/data/${id}`, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    next: { revalidate: 60 }, // Cache for 60 seconds
  });
  
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch data: ${res.statusText}`);
  }
  
  return res.json();
}
```

#### Component Architecture Patterns
**Polymorphic Component Design:**
```typescript
interface PolymorphicComponentProps<T extends React.ElementType> {
  as?: T;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}

type ComponentProps<T extends React.ElementType> = PolymorphicComponentProps<T> &
  Omit<React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T>, keyof PolymorphicComponentProps<T>>;

function PolymorphicComponent<T extends React.ElementType = 'div'>({
  as,
  children,
  className,
  ...props
}: ComponentProps<T>) {
  const Component = as || 'div';
  return (
    <Component className={cn('base-styles', className)} {...props}>
      {children}
    </Component>
  );
}
```

**Compound Component Patterns:**
```typescript
interface TabsContextType {
  activeTab: string;
  setActiveTab: (tab: string) => void;
}

const TabsContext = React.createContext<TabsContextType | null>(null);

export function Tabs({ children, defaultTab }: TabsProps) {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(defaultTab);
  
  return (
    <TabsContext.Provider value={{ activeTab, setActiveTab }}>
      <div className="tabs-container">{children}</div>
    </TabsContext.Provider>
  );
}

Tabs.List = TabsList;
Tabs.Trigger = TabsTrigger;
Tabs.Content = TabsContent;
```

#### Performance Optimization Implementation
**React Query Integration:**
```typescript
// Optimized data fetching with React Query
function useUserData(userId: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['user', userId],
    queryFn: () => fetchUser(userId),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
    retry: (failureCount, error) => failureCount < 3 && error.status !== 404,
  });
}

// Optimistic updates with proper error handling
function useUpdateUser() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: updateUser,
    onMutate: async (newUserData) => {
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['user', newUserData.id] });
      const previousUser = queryClient.getQueryData(['user', newUserData.id]);
      queryClient.setQueryData(['user', newUserData.id], newUserData);
      return { previousUser };
    },
    onError: (err, newUserData, context) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(['user', newUserData.id], context?.previousUser);
    },
    onSettled: (data, error, variables) => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['user', variables.id] });
    },
  });
}
```

**Memoization and Performance Patterns:**
```typescript
// Proper memoization patterns
const ExpensiveComponent = memo(function ExpensiveComponent({ 
  data, 
  onUpdate 
}: ExpensiveComponentProps) {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    return expensiveDataProcessing(data);
  }, [data]);
  
  const handleUpdate = useCallback((newValue: string) => {
    onUpdate(newValue);
  }, [onUpdate]);
  
  return (
    <div>
      {processedData.map(item => (
        <Item key={item.id} item={item} onUpdate={handleUpdate} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
});
```

### Quality Assurance and Testing Excellence

#### Component Testing Strategies
**React Testing Library Patterns:**
```typescript
// Comprehensive component testing
describe('UserProfile Component', () => {
  const mockUser = {
    id: '1',
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
  };
  
  it('renders user information correctly', () => {
    render(<UserProfile user={mockUser} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText(mockUser.name)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(mockUser.email)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  it('handles user interaction properly', async () => {
    const mockOnEdit = jest.fn();
    render(<UserProfile user={mockUser} onEdit={mockOnEdit} />);
    
    const editButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /edit/i });
    await user.click(editButton);
    
    expect(mockOnEdit).toHaveBeenCalledWith(mockUser.id);
  });
  
  it('meets accessibility standards', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<UserProfile user={mockUser} />);
    const results = await axe(container);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
  });
});
```

**E2E Testing with Playwright:**
```typescript
// End-to-end testing patterns
test.describe('User Dashboard', () => {
  test('user can navigate through dashboard sections', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/dashboard');
    
    // Test navigation
    await page.click('[data-testid="settings-tab"]');
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="settings-content"]')).toBeVisible();
    
    // Test form interaction
    await page.fill('[data-testid="user-name-input"]', 'Updated Name');
    await page.click('[data-testid="save-button"]');
    
    // Verify success
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="success-message"]')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```
