## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY code review action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing code review patterns with comprehensive search: `grep -r "review\|audit\|security\|performance" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yml"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working code review methodologies with existing capabilities
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy Code Review Architecture**
- Every code review methodology must use existing, documented review capabilities and real tool integrations
- All review workflows must work with current development infrastructure and available analysis tools
- No theoretical review patterns or "placeholder" review capabilities
- All tool integrations must exist and be accessible in target development environment
- Review coordination mechanisms must be real, documented, and tested
- Review specializations must address actual domain expertise from proven review capabilities
- Configuration variables must exist in environment or config files with validated schemas
- All review workflows must resolve to tested patterns with specific success criteria
- No assumptions about "future" review capabilities or planned development enhancements
- Review performance metrics must be measurable with current monitoring infrastructure

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Code Review Functionality - Review Integration Safety**
- Before implementing new review processes, verify current review workflows and coordination patterns
- All new review designs must preserve existing review behaviors and coordination protocols
- Review specialization must not break existing multi-reviewer workflows or approval pipelines
- New review tools must not block legitimate development workflows or existing integrations
- Changes to review coordination must maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
- Review modifications must not alter expected input/output formats for existing processes
- Review additions must not impact existing logging and metrics collection
- Rollback procedures must restore exact previous review coordination without workflow loss
- All modifications must pass existing review validation suites before adding new capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines must enhance, not replace, existing review validation processes
