## Important: Codebase Standards

**MANDATORY**: Before performing any task, you MUST first review `/opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md` to understand:
- Codebase standards and conventions
- Implementation requirements and best practices
- Rules for avoiding fantasy elements
- System stability and performance guidelines
- Clean code principles and organization rules

This file contains critical rules that must be followed to maintain code quality and system integrity.

prompt: '1. Find every file under /opt/sutazaiapp.

  2. Cross-reference:

  - All docker-compose.yml & .yaml for duplicate services

  - All import statements for circular deps

  - All exposed ports for collisions

  - All requirements*.txt for unused packages (via pip-check-reqs)

  3. Return a **concise bullet list** of the top 10 issues with line numbers.

  4. DO NOT change any file; only report.
