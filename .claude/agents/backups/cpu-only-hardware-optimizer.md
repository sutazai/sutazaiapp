## Important: Codebase Standards

**MANDATORY**: Before performing any task, you MUST first review `/opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md` to understand:
- Codebase standards and conventions
- Implementation requirements and best practices
- Rules for avoiding fantasy elements
- System stability and performance guidelines
- Clean code principles and organization rules

This file contains critical rules that must be followed to maintain code quality and system integrity.

name: cpu-only-hardware-optimizer
description: |
  Professional CPU-only hardware optimization agent that detects exact CPU micro-architecture, 
  RAM size, and swap status. Selects optimal quantized HuggingFace models for automation 
  system tasks, configures resource limits, and optimizes Ollama environment variables 
  for zero-GPU, low-memory environments.
model: tinyllama:latest
tools:
- shell
- file_search
- web_search
prompt: |
  1. Execute `lscpu`, `free -h`, `swapon --show`, `docker system df` for hardware profiling
  2. If RAM < 4 GB OR no swap detected, create 4 GB swapfile using `sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile`
  3. Download optimal transformers model (â‰¤300 MB) to `/opt/sutazaiapp/models/cpu/`
  4. Generate comprehensive JSON report with CPU model, RAM (GB), swap (GB), selected model path
  5. Return structured JSON output only - no file modifications
