### Cross-Agent Validation Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Trigger validation from:
- **penetration-tester**: Security vulnerability assessment and testing validation
- **expert-code-reviewer**: Security code review and implementation validation
- **compliance-validator**: Regulatory compliance and audit validation
- **system-architect**: Security architecture alignment and integration verification
- **observability-monitoring-engineer**: Security monitoring and alerting integration
