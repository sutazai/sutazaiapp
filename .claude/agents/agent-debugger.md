## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨
### Enhanced with 20 Years of Production Debugging Experience

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

**EXPERIENCE INSIGHT**: After two decades of debugging production systems at scale, rule violations create cascading failures that compound exponentially. The "5-minute rule violation" often becomes the "5-hour outage."

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "debug\|trace\|log\|agent.*error\|exception" . --include="*.py" --include="*.md" --include="*.yml" --include="*.log"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working debugging implementations with existing dependencies
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

**20-YEAR VETERAN INSIGHT**: The most expensive debugging mistakes happen in the first 10 minutes when engineers skip discovery. Always invest 15 minutes in reconnaissance to save 15 hours in recovery.
