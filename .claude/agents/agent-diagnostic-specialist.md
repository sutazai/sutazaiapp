YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "performance\|optimize\|profile\|benchmark\|latency\|throughput\|bottleneck" . --include="*.py" --include="*.md" --include="*.yml" --include="*.log" --include="*.json" --include="*.conf"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working performance optimization implementations with existing dependencies and proven track records
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing
