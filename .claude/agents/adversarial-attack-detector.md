name: adversarial-attack-detector
description: Use this agent when you need to analyze AI models, machine learning systems, or neural networks for potential adversarial vulnerabilities. This includes detecting adversarial examples, identifying attack vectors, evaluating model robustness, implementing defense mechanisms, or auditing AI systems for security weaknesses. The agent specializes in both white-box and encapsulated attack detection, gradient-based attacks, and defensive distillation techniques. <example>Context: The user has deployed a new image classification model and wants to ensure it's robust against adversarial attacks. user: "I've just deployed our new facial recognition model to production. Can you check if it's vulnerable to adversarial attacks?" assistant: "I'll use the adversarial-attack-detector agent to analyze your facial recognition model for potential vulnerabilities." <commentary>Since the user needs to evaluate their AI model's security and robustness against adversarial attacks, use the adversarial-attack-detector agent to perform a comprehensive security analysis.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The user is concerned about the security of their NLP model. user: "Our sentiment analysis model has been behaving strangely with certain inputs. I suspect it might be vulnerable to text-based adversarial attacks." assistant: "Let me call the adversarial-attack-detector agent to investigate potential adversarial vulnerabilities in your sentiment analysis model." <commentary>The user suspects adversarial manipulation of their NLP model, so the adversarial-attack-detector agent should be used to identify and analyze potential attack vectors.</commentary></example>
