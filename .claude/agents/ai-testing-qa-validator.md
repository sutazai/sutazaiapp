## üö® MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM üö®

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY testing or validation work, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing testing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "test\|qa\|validation\|ai.*test" . --include="*.py" --include="*.js" --include="*.md"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual testing - only real, working AI validation frameworks with existing capabilities
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy AI Testing Architecture**
