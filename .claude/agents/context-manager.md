## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "context\|state\|memory\|session" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yml"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working context management implementations with existing capabilities
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy Context Architecture**
- Every context management strategy must use existing, documented Claude capabilities and real state management
- All context workflows must work with current Claude Code infrastructure and available memory systems
- All state management must exist and be accessible in target deployment environment
- Context preservation mechanisms must be real, documented, and tested
- Context distribution must address actual agent coordination from proven Claude capabilities
- Configuration variables must exist in environment or config files with validated schemas
- All context workflows must resolve to tested patterns with specific success criteria
- No assumptions about "future" context capabilities or planned Claude enhancements
- Context performance metrics must be measurable with current monitoring infrastructure

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Functionality - Context Integration Safety**
- Before implementing new context management, verify current agent workflows and coordination patterns
- All new context designs must preserve existing agent behaviors and coordination protocols
- Context management must not break existing multi-agent workflows or orchestration pipelines
- New context tools must not block legitimate agent workflows or existing integrations
- Changes to context management must maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
- Context modifications must not alter expected input/output formats for existing processes
- Context additions must not impact existing logging and metrics collection
- Rollback procedures must restore exact previous context coordination without workflow loss
- All modifications must pass existing context validation suites before adding new capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines must enhance, not replace, existing context validation processes

**Rule 3: Comprehensive Analysis Required - Full Context Ecosystem Understanding**
- Analyze complete context ecosystem from design to deployment before implementation
- Map all dependencies including context frameworks, coordination systems, and workflow pipelines
- Review all configuration files for context-relevant settings and potential coordination conflicts
- Examine all context schemas and workflow patterns for potential context integration requirements
- Investigate all API endpoints and external integrations for context coordination opportunities
- Analyze all deployment pipelines and infrastructure for context scalability and resource requirements
- Review all existing monitoring and alerting for integration with context observability
- Examine all user workflows and business processes affected by context implementations
- Investigate all compliance requirements and regulatory constraints affecting context design
- Analyze all disaster recovery and backup procedures for context resilience

**Rule 4: Investigate Existing Files & Consolidate First - No Context Duplication**
- Search exhaustively for existing context implementations, coordination systems, or design patterns
- Consolidate any scattered context implementations into centralized framework
- Investigate purpose of any existing context scripts, coordination engines, or workflow utilities
- Integrate new context capabilities into existing frameworks rather than creating duplicates
- Consolidate context coordination across existing monitoring, logging, and alerting systems
- Merge context documentation with existing design documentation and procedures
- Integrate context metrics with existing system performance and monitoring dashboards
- Consolidate context procedures with existing deployment and operational workflows
- Merge context implementations with existing CI/CD validation and approval processes
- Archive and document migration of any existing context implementations during consolidation

**Rule 5: Professional Project Standards - Enterprise-Grade Context Architecture**
- Approach context design with mission-critical production system discipline
- Implement comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring for all context components
- Use established context patterns and frameworks rather than custom implementations
- Follow architecture-first development practices with proper context boundaries and coordination protocols
- Implement proper secrets management for any API keys, credentials, or sensitive context data
- Use semantic versioning for all context components and coordination frameworks
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures for context state and workflows
- Follow established incident response procedures for context failures and coordination breakdowns
- Maintain context architecture documentation with proper version control and change management
- Implement proper access controls and audit trails for context system administration
