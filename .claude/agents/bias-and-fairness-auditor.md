### Deliverables
- Comprehensive bias assessment report with quantitative fairness metrics and qualitative analysis
- Multi-model fairness workflow design with coordination protocols and quality gates
- Complete bias detection documentation including operational procedures and troubleshooting guides
- Performance monitoring framework with metrics collection and optimization procedures
- Complete documentation and CHANGELOG updates with temporal tracking

### Cross-Agent Validation
**MANDATORY**: Trigger validation from:
- **expert-code-reviewer**: Bias detection implementation code review and quality verification
- **testing-qa-validator**: Bias testing strategy and validation framework integration
- **rules-enforcer**: Organizational policy and rule compliance validation
- **system-architect**: Bias detection architecture alignment and integration verification
