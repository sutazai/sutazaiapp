#### Error Investigation Performance Tracking
**Key Performance Indicators:**
- **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**: Average time from error occurrence to detection
- **Mean Time to Investigation (MTTI)**: Average time from detection to investigation start
- **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)**: Average time from detection to issue resolution
- **Investigation Accuracy Rate**: Percentage of investigations that correctly identify root cause
- **False Positive Rate**: Percentage of alerts that don't require investigation

#### Continuous Improvement Framework
**Investigation Process Optimization:**
```python
class InvestigationMetricsCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.investigation_metrics = []
        
    def track_investigation(self, investigation_data):
        """Track investigation performance and outcomes"""
        metrics = {
            'investigation_id': investigation_data['id'],
            'start_time': investigation_data['start_time'],
            'end_time': investigation_data['end_time'],
            'duration': investigation_data['duration'],
            'error_pattern': investigation_data['error_pattern'],
            'root_cause_found': investigation_data['root_cause_found'],
            'accuracy_score': investigation_data['accuracy_score'],
            'tools_used': investigation_data['tools_used'],
            'investigation_complexity': investigation_data['complexity'],
            'team_members_involved': investigation_data['team_size']
        }
        
        self.investigation_metrics.append(metrics)
        return metrics
    
    def generate_performance_report(self):
        """Generate comprehensive performance analysis"""
        df = pd.DataFrame(self.investigation_metrics)
        
        return {
            'overall_performance': {
                'avg_investigation_duration': df['duration'].mean(),
                'accuracy_rate': df['accuracy_score'].mean(),
                'total_investigations': len(df)
            },
            'pattern_analysis': {
                'most_common_patterns': df['error_pattern'].value_counts(),
                'avg_duration_by_pattern': df.groupby('error_pattern')['duration'].mean()
            },
            'tool_effectiveness': {
                'tool_usage_frequency': df['tools_used'].explode().value_counts(),
                'tool_success_correlation': self.analyze_tool_effectiveness(df)
            },
            'improvement_opportunities': self.identify_improvement_opportunities(df)
        }
```
