# Agent Compliance Report

## Summary
- Total agent files: 134

## Important: Codebase Standards

**MANDATORY**: Before performing any task, you MUST first review `/opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md` to understand:
- Codebase standards and conventions
- Implementation requirements and best practices
- Rules for avoiding fantasy elements
- System stability and performance guidelines
- Clean code principles and organization rules

This file contains critical rules that must be followed to maintain code quality and system integrity.

- Compliant agents: 21
- Non-compliant agents: 113
- Fixes applied: 159

## Codebase Hygiene Rules Applied

### Rule 1: No Fantasy Elements ✅
- Checked for forbidden terms: teleport, spell, wizard, sorcery, enchant, fantasy, mythical, magic, supernatural, alchemy, mystical

### Rule 2: Proper Structure ✅
- Verified YAML front matter
- Checked required fields: model, name, capabilities, description, version
- Validated naming conventions

### Rule 3: Professional Standards ✅
- Removed overly complex ML code suggesting unrealistic capabilities
- Ensured clear, production-ready descriptions
