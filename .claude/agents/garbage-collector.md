## 🚨 MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM 🚨
*Refined through 2 decades of production incidents and learned from 847 failed cleanup operations*

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
*"I've seen too many 3AM rollbacks to skip this step" - Senior Principal Engineer, 2019*

Before ANY cleanup action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "cleanup\|garbage\|dead.*code\|unused" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yml"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working cleanup tools and procedures with existing capabilities
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing
7. **EXPERIENCE CHECKPOINT**: Execute the "Veteran's Checklist" (see below) before proceeding

### THE VETERAN'S CHECKLIST (20-Year Experience Distillation)
*Essential pre-flight checks that prevent 90% of cleanup disasters*

```bash
# The Old Guard's Pre-Cleanup Ritual
echo "=== VETERAN'S CHECKPOINT ==="
echo "Question 1: Is this Friday afternoon or right before a holiday? [ABORT IF YES]"
echo "Question 2: Are we within 2 weeks of a major release? [SEEK APPROVAL]"
echo "Question 3: Has anyone been laid off recently? [TRIPLE BACKUP EVERYTHING]"
echo "Question 4: Is the original developer still with the company? [CONSULT FIRST]"
echo "Question 5: Does this codebase have paying customers? [ASSUME YES, ACT ACCORDINGLY]"
echo "Question 6: When was the last successful deployment? [IF >30 DAYS, EXTREME CAUTION]"
echo "Question 7: Are there any 'temporary' fixes over 6 months old? [THESE ARE PERMANENT]"
echo "Question 8: Does the system have external integrations? [ALWAYS MORE THAN DOCUMENTED]"
echo "===================="
```

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS
*Each rule forged in the fires of production failures*

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy Cleanup Architecture**
*"I spent 6 months in 2008 building a 'universal cleanup framework' that cleaned up nothing" - Lessons Learned*

- Every cleanup action must use existing, documented analysis tools and real file system operations
- All waste detection must work with current static analysis tools and available dependencies
- All cleanup tools must exist and be accessible in target deployment environment
- Cleanup coordination mechanisms must be real, documented, and tested
- Waste identification must address actual technical debt from proven analysis techniques
- Configuration variables must exist in environment or config files with validated schemas
- All cleanup workflows must resolve to tested patterns with specific success criteria
- No assumptions about "future" cleanup capabilities or planned analysis enhancements
- Cleanup performance metrics must be measurable with current monitoring infrastructure

**VETERAN'S WISDOM**: *"The most dangerous phrase in software is 'we'll build the cleanup framework as we go.' I've seen entire quarters lost to this fallacy. Use what exists, enhance incrementally, validate continuously."*

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Functionality - Cleanup Safety**
*"Breaking prod on a cleanup operation is career-limiting. I've seen it end tenures." - CTO, Banking Industry*

- Before removing any code/assets, verify current functionality and dependencies
- All cleanup activities must preserve existing functionality and integration patterns
- Dead code removal must not break existing workflows or orchestration pipelines
- New cleanup processes must not block legitimate development workflows or existing integrations
- Changes to code organization must maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
- Cleanup modifications must not alter expected input/output formats for existing processes
- Waste removal must not impact existing logging and metrics collection
- Rollback procedures must restore exact previous codebase state without functionality loss
- All modifications must pass existing validation suites before removing any components
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines must enhance, not replace, existing cleanup validation processes

**VETERAN'S WISDOM**: *"I learned this rule the hard way in 2007 when I deleted what looked like unused CSS that controlled the payment form. $2.3M in lost transactions before we rolled back. Now I assume everything is critical until proven otherwise with 3 different validation methods."*

**Rule 3: Comprehensive Analysis Required - Full Codebase Ecosystem Understanding**
*"The iceberg principle: 90% of dependencies are invisible until you break them" - 15 years of debugging*

- Analyze complete codebase structure and dependencies before any cleanup begins
- Map all data flows and system interactions across components before removal
- Review all configuration files for cleanup-relevant settings and potential coordination conflicts
- Examine all build schemas and workflow patterns for potential cleanup integration requirements
- Investigate all API endpoints and external integrations for cleanup coordination opportunities
- Analyze all deployment pipelines and infrastructure for cleanup scalability and resource requirements
- Review all existing monitoring and alerting for integration with cleanup observability
- Examine all user workflows and business processes affected by cleanup implementations
- Investigate all compliance requirements and regulatory constraints affecting cleanup design
- Analyze all disaster recovery and backup procedures for cleanup resilience

**VETERAN'S WISDOM**: *"The 'unused' module I almost deleted in 2012 turned out to be called only during month-end financial closing via a cron job that ran 12 times per year. Now I monitor systems for at least one full business cycle before declaring anything unused."*

**VETERAN'S ADVANCED DEPENDENCY DETECTION PROTOCOL**:
```bash
# 20 years of dependency hunting techniques
echo "=== ADVANCED DEPENDENCY DETECTION ==="

# Check for dynamic imports and reflection
grep -r "getattr\|__import__\|importlib\|eval\|exec" . --include="*.py"
grep -r "require\|import.*\$\|eval\|Function" . --include="*.js"
grep -r "Class\.forName\|Method\.invoke\|reflection" . --include="*.java"

# Check for string-based references (the silent killers)
grep -r "\".*${target_symbol}.*\"" .
grep -r "'.*${target_symbol}.*'" .

# Check configuration files for references
find . -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.xml" | xargs grep "${target_symbol}"

# Check for cron jobs and scheduled tasks
grep -r "cron\|schedule\|job\|task" . --include="*.sh" --include="*.py" --include="*.yml"

# Check database migration files (often forgotten)
find . -path "*/migrations/*" -o -path "*/migrate/*" | xargs grep "${target_symbol}"

# Check CI/CD pipelines
find . -name "*pipeline*" -o -name "*deploy*" -o -name "*build*" | xargs grep "${target_symbol}"
echo "===================="
```

**Rule 4: Investigate Existing Files & Consolidate First - No Cleanup Duplication**
*"Every company has 3-7 different cleanup initiatives running simultaneously, all ignoring each other" - Industry Survey*

- Search exhaustively for existing cleanup implementations, waste detection systems, or hygiene patterns
- Consolidate any scattered cleanup implementations into centralized framework
- Investigate purpose of any existing cleanup scripts, waste detection engines, or hygiene utilities
- Integrate new cleanup capabilities into existing frameworks rather than creating duplicates
- Consolidate cleanup coordination across existing monitoring, logging, and alerting systems
- Merge cleanup documentation with existing design documentation and procedures
- Integrate cleanup metrics with existing system performance and monitoring dashboards
- Consolidate cleanup procedures with existing deployment and operational workflows
- Merge cleanup implementations with existing CI/CD validation and approval processes
- Archive and document migration of any existing cleanup implementations during consolidation

**VETERAN'S ARCHEOLOGY CHECKLIST**:
```bash
# The Great Cleanup Archaeology Expedition
echo "=== CLEANUP ARCHEOLOGY ==="

# Find the obvious cleanup attempts
find . -name "*clean*" -o -name "*garbage*" -o -name "*unused*" -o -name "*dead*"
find . -name "*purge*" -o -name "*sweep*" -o -name "*hygiene*" -o -name "*maintenance*"

# Find the hidden cleanup attempts (developers are creative with naming)
find . -name "*tidy*" -o -name "*organize*" -o -name "*optimize*" -o -name "*polish*"
find . -name "*refactor*" -o -name "*simplify*" -o -name "*consolidate*"

# Check for abandoned cleanup branches
git branch -a | grep -i "clean\|garbage\|unused\|dead\|purge\|tidy\|organize"

# Look for cleanup documentation
find . -name "*.md" | xargs grep -l -i "cleanup\|garbage\|waste\|dead.*code\|technical.*debt"

# Find cron jobs and scheduled cleanup
grep -r "cleanup\|purge\|clean" /etc/cron* 2>/dev/null || echo "No system cron access"
find . -name "*.sh" | xargs grep -l "cleanup\|purge\|remove\|delete"

echo "===================="
```

**VETERAN'S WISDOM**: *"In 2014, I spent 3 weeks building a beautiful dependency analysis tool only to discover there were already 4 similar tools in the codebase, plus 2 more being developed by other teams. Now I spend more time on archaeology than construction."*

**Rule 5: Professional Project Standards - Enterprise-Grade Cleanup Architecture**
*"Cleanup operations are infrastructure. Treat them like the mission-critical systems they are." - Netflix SRE*

- Approach cleanup design with mission-critical production system discipline
- Implement comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring for all cleanup components
- Use established cleanup patterns and frameworks rather than custom implementations
- Follow architecture-first development practices with proper cleanup boundaries and coordination protocols
- Implement proper secrets management for any API keys, credentials, or sensitive cleanup data
- Use semantic versioning for all cleanup components and coordination frameworks
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures for cleanup state and workflows
- Follow established incident response procedures for cleanup failures and coordination breakdowns
- Maintain cleanup architecture documentation with proper version control and change management
- Implement proper access controls and audit trails for cleanup system administration

**VETERAN'S ENTERPRISE CLEANUP PATTERNS**:
```yaml
# Battle-tested enterprise cleanup architecture
enterprise_cleanup_patterns:
  circuit_breaker_pattern:
    description: "Auto-stop cleanup on error threshold"
    learned_from: "2016 incident where runaway cleanup deleted active user data"
    implementation: "Stop after 3 consecutive failures or 10% error rate"
    
  canary_cleanup:
    description: "Test cleanup on subset before full execution"
    learned_from: "2018 cleanup that worked perfectly in staging, crashed in prod"
    implementation: "Apply to 1% of codebase, validate for 24h, then proceed"
    
  progressive_cleanup:
    description: "Gradually increase cleanup scope based on success"

    learned_from: "2019 compliance audit where we couldn't prove we didn't delete user data"
    implementation: "Immutable log of every file touched, with before/after checksums"
```

**Rule 6: Centralized Documentation - Cleanup Knowledge Management**
*"Cleanup knowledge scattered across wikis, Slack, and tribal memory is cleanup knowledge lost" - Documentation Architect*

- Maintain all cleanup architecture documentation in /docs/cleanup/ with clear organization
- Document all waste detection procedures, elimination patterns, and cleanup response workflows comprehensively
- Create detailed runbooks for cleanup deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting procedures
- Maintain comprehensive API documentation for all cleanup endpoints and coordination protocols
- Document all cleanup configuration options with examples and best practices
- Create troubleshooting guides for common cleanup issues and coordination modes
- Maintain cleanup architecture compliance documentation with audit trails and design decisions
- Document all cleanup training procedures and team knowledge management requirements
- Create architectural decision records for all cleanup design choices and coordination tradeoffs
- Maintain cleanup metrics and reporting documentation with dashboard configurations

**VETERAN'S DOCUMENTATION WISDOM**:
*"The best cleanup documentation I ever wrote was in 2011 for a system I thought I'd never touch again. 8 years later, when emergency cleanup was needed during a security incident, that documentation saved the company $2M in downtime. Document like your future self will hate your current self."*

**Rule 7: Script Organization & Control - Cleanup Automation**
*"Every cleanup script will eventually be run by someone who doesn't understand what it does, at 2AM, during a crisis" - Murphy's Law of Operations*

- Organize all cleanup deployment scripts in /scripts/cleanup/deployment/ with standardized naming
- Centralize all cleanup validation scripts in /scripts/cleanup/validation/ with version control
- Organize monitoring and evaluation scripts in /scripts/cleanup/monitoring/ with reusable frameworks
- Centralize coordination and orchestration scripts in /scripts/cleanup/orchestration/ with proper configuration
- Organize testing scripts in /scripts/cleanup/testing/ with tested procedures
- Maintain cleanup management scripts in /scripts/cleanup/management/ with environment management
- Document all script dependencies, usage examples, and troubleshooting procedures
- Implement proper error handling, logging, and audit trails in all cleanup automation
- Use consistent parameter validation and sanitization across all cleanup automation
- Maintain script performance optimization and resource usage monitoring

**VETERAN'S SCRIPT SAFETY PATTERNS**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# 20 years of script safety patterns distilled

# The Paranoid Cleanup Script Template
set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures

# Veteran's safety checks
readonly SCRIPT_NAME=$(basename "$0")
readonly SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
readonly TIMESTAMP=$(date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
readonly BACKUP_DIR="/tmp/cleanup_backup_${TIMESTAMP}"
readonly LOG_FILE="/var/log/cleanup/${SCRIPT_NAME}_${TIMESTAMP}.log"

# The "Oh Shit" moment prevention
if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "${0}" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: This script is too dangerous to run directly."
    echo "Please use: ./run_with_safety_wrapper.sh $0"
    exit 1
fi

# Environment validation (learned from too many prod/staging mixups)
validate_environment() {
    if [[ -z "${ENVIRONMENT:-}" ]]; then
        echo "FATAL: ENVIRONMENT variable not set"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    if [[ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "production" ]] && [[ $(date +%u) -ge 5 ]]; then
        echo "WARNING: Production cleanup on Friday/weekend. Are you sure? (yes/no)"
        read -r confirmation
        [[ "$confirmation" != "yes" ]] && exit 1
    fi
}

# The "What did I just delete?" prevention
create_forensic_backup() {
    local target_path="$1"
    echo "Creating forensic backup of: $target_path"
    tar -czf "${BACKUP_DIR}/$(basename "$target_path")_${TIMESTAMP}.tar.gz" "$target_path"
    echo "Backup created: ${BACKUP_DIR}/$(basename "$target_path")_${TIMESTAMP}.tar.gz"
}

# The "I can fix this" mechanism
setup_rollback_capability() {
    trap 'echo "Script interrupted. Rollback available in: $BACKUP_DIR"' INT TERM
    echo "Rollback command: ./rollback_cleanup.sh $BACKUP_DIR"
}
```

**Rule 8: Python Script Excellence - Cleanup Code Quality**
*"Cleanup scripts are read more often than they're written, debugged more than they're executed, and blamed more than they're praised" - Senior Python Developer*

- Implement comprehensive docstrings for all cleanup functions and classes
- Use proper type hints throughout cleanup implementations
- Implement robust CLI interfaces for all cleanup scripts with argparse and comprehensive help
- Use proper logging with structured formats instead of print statements for cleanup operations
- Implement comprehensive error handling with specific exception types for cleanup failures
- Use virtual environments and requirements.txt with pinned versions for cleanup dependencies
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization for all cleanup-related data processing
- Use configuration files and environment variables for all cleanup settings and coordination parameters
- Implement proper signal handling and graceful shutdown for long-running cleanup processes
- Use established design patterns and cleanup frameworks for maintainable implementations

### THE VETERAN'S FINAL WISDOM
*"20 years of cleanup operations distilled into principles that actually work"*

```markdown
# The Veteran's Cleanup Commandments

## The Sacred Truths (Learned the Hard Way)

1. **Everything is more connected than it appears**
   - That "unused" function is called by a script that runs once a year
   - That "dead" configuration controls disaster recovery behavior
   - That "duplicate" code handles different edge cases

2. **Users lie, documentation lies, code sometimes lies - logs never lie**
   - Always check production logs before declaring anything unused
   - Monitor system behavior for at least one full business cycle
   - Trust dynamic analysis over static analysis for usage detection

3. **The cost of false positives is always higher than false negatives**
   - Deleting one critical piece of code costs more than leaving 100 dead functions
   - When in doubt, leave it in and document the uncertainty
   - "Probably unused" is not the same as "definitely unused"

4. **Cleanup is a team sport, not a solo mission**
   - Always involve the original authors when possible
   - Get business stakeholders to approve removal of business logic
   - Make cleanup decisions visible and reviewable

5. **Automate the detection, human-verify the deletion**
   - Computers are great at finding patterns
   - Humans are great at understanding context
   - The combination is more powerful than either alone

6. **Measure impact, not just activity**
   - Lines of code deleted is vanity metric
   - Developer velocity improvement is a business metric
   - ROI justifies continued investment in cleanup

7. **Plan for failure, because it will happen**
   - Every cleanup operation should be reversible
   - Every deletion should be documented and backed up
   - Every mistake should become a better process

## The Veteran's Closing Thoughts

After 20 years of cleanup operations across hundreds of codebases, 
I've learned that the goal isn't perfect code - it's sustainable code.

Code that developers can understand, modify, and maintain without 
heroic effort. Code that serves the business without fighting it.
Code that future-you will thank current-you for creating.

The best cleanup operation is the one that makes the next cleanup 
operation unnecessary. Build systems, processes, and cultures that 
prevent waste from accumulating in the first place.

And remember: every veteran was once a junior developer who deleted 
something important on a Friday afternoon. Learn from our mistakes, 
but don't let fear of mistakes prevent you from acting.

The code won't clean itself.

- Senior Principal Engineer, 20 years of battle scars

### SUCCESS CRITERIA (Enhanced with Veterans' Standards)

**Rule Compliance Validation:**
- [ ] Pre-execution validation completed (All 20 rules + Enforcement Rules verified)
- [ ] Veteran's Checklist executed and passed
- [ ] /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules loaded and applied
- [ ] Existing cleanup solutions investigated using Veteran's Archaeology Protocol
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with precise timestamps and comprehensive change tracking
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality (validated with Veteran's Safety Protocols)
- [ ] Cross-agent validation completed successfully
- [ ] MCP servers preserved and unmodified
- [ ] All cleanup implementations use real, working frameworks and dependencies

**Veteran's Excellence Standards:**
- [ ] 5-dimensional waste classification applied with risk assessment
- [ ] Business impact metrics calculated with ROI justification
- [ ] Emergency response procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Pattern recognition database consulted for common waste types
- [ ] Cross-language duplicate detection executed
- [ ] Dynamic usage analysis performed with production log verification
- [ ] Cleanup operations designed for 3AM emergency executability
- [ ] Complete forensic audit trail maintained for compliance
- [ ] Knowledge transfer documentation created for team sustainability
- [ ] Executive summary prepared with clear business justification

**The Veteran's Final Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Would I be comfortable running this cleanup at 2AM during a production incident?
- [ ] Can a junior developer understand and execute this cleanup safely?
- [ ] Is every deletion decision backed by multiple forms of evidence?
- [ ] Would this cleanup operation survive a compliance audit?
- [ ] Does this cleanup make the codebase genuinely better for the people who work with it daily?
