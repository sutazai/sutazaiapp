{
    private array $metrics = [];
    private float $startTime;
    
    public function startProfiling(string $operation): void
    {
        $this->startTime = microtime(true);
        $this->metrics[$operation] = [
            'start_time' => $this->startTime,
            'memory_start' => memory_get_usage(true),
            'peak_memory_start' => memory_get_peak_usage(true)
        ];
    }
    
    public function endProfiling(string $operation): array
    {
        $endTime = microtime(true);
        $this->metrics[$operation]['end_time'] = $endTime;
        $this->metrics[$operation]['execution_time'] = $endTime - $this->startTime;
        $this->metrics[$operation]['memory_end'] = memory_get_usage(true);
        $this->metrics[$operation]['memory_used'] = 
            $this->metrics[$operation]['memory_end'] - 
            $this->metrics[$operation]['memory_start'];
        $this->metrics[$operation]['peak_memory'] = memory_get_peak_usage(true);

        $indexRecommendations = $this->generateIndexRecommendations($sql);
        
        return [
            'original_query' => $sql,
            'optimized_query' => $optimizedQuery,

```

**Modern PHP Patterns and Best Practices:**
```php
<?php
// Modern PHP implementation with type safety and performance
declare(strict_types=1);

use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;
use Psr\Cache\CacheItemPoolInterface;

final readonly class UserService
{
    public function __construct(
        private UserRepositoryInterface $userRepository,
        private LoggerInterface $logger,
        private CacheItemPoolInterface $cache,
        private EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher
    ) {}
    
    public function createUser(CreateUserDTO $userData): User
    {
        // Input validation with modern PHP features
        $this->validateUserData($userData);
        
        try {
            $user = $this->userRepository->create($userData);
            
            // Cache invalidation and event dispatching
            $this->cache->deleteItem("user_list");
            $this->eventDispatcher->dispatch(new UserCreatedEvent($user));
            
            $this->logger->info('User created successfully', [
                'user_id' => $user->getId(),
                'email' => $user->getEmail(),
                'created_at' => $user->getCreatedAt()->format('c')
            ]);
            
            return $user;
            
        } catch (UserCreationException $e) {
            $this->logger->error('User creation failed', [
                'email' => $userData->email,
                'error' => $e->getMessage(),
                'trace' => $e->getTraceAsString()
            ]);
            
            throw $e;
        }
    }
    
    private function validateUserData(CreateUserDTO $userData): void
    {
        if (!filter_var($userData->email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
            throw new InvalidEmailException('Invalid email format provided');
        }
        
        if (strlen($userData->password) < 12) {
            throw new WeakPasswordException('Password must be at least 12 characters long');
        }
    }
}
```

            $this->logger,
            $this->cache,
            $this->eventDispatcher
        );
    }
    
    #[Test]
    public function itCreatesUserSuccessfully(): void
    {
        // Arrange
        $userData = new CreateUserDTO(

            ->expects($this->once())
            ->method('create')
            ->with($userData)
            ->willReturn($expectedUser);
            
        $this->cache
            ->expects($this->once())

        return [
            'missing at symbol' => ['testexample.com'],
            'missing domain' => ['test@'],
            'invalid characters' => ['test@exam ple.com'],
            'empty email' => [''],
        ];
    }
}
```

#### PHP Security Implementation

```php
<?php
final readonly class SecurityService
{
    public function __construct(
        private string $jwtSecret,
        private HashingInterface $hasher,
        private RateLimiterInterface $rateLimiter
    ) {}
    
    public function authenticateUser(string $email, string $password): AuthResult
    {
        // Rate limiting
        if (!$this->rateLimiter->attempt($email, 5, 300)) {
            throw new TooManyAttemptsException('Too many login attempts');
        }
        
        // Input sanitization
        $email = filter_var(trim($email), FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL);
        if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
            throw new InvalidInputException('Invalid email format');
        }
        
        // Secure password verification

### PHP Performance Optimization and Monitoring

#### Performance Metrics and Monitoring
**Real-Time Performance Tracking:**
```php
<?php
class PHPPerformanceMonitor
{
    private array $metrics = [];
    
    public function trackDatabaseQuery(string $query, float $executionTime): void
    {
        $this->metrics['database']['queries'][] = [
            'query' => $query,
            'execution_time' => $executionTime,
            'timestamp' => microtime(true),
            'memory_usage' => memory_get_usage(true)
        ];
        
        // Alert on slow queries
        if ($executionTime > 1.0) {
            $this->alertSlowQuery($query, $executionTime);
        }
    }
    
    public function trackAPIResponse(string $endpoint, float $responseTime): void
    {
        $this->metrics['api']['responses'][] = [
            'endpoint' => $endpoint,
            'response_time' => $responseTime,
            'timestamp' => microtime(true),
            'memory_peak' => memory_get_peak_usage(true)
        ];
    }
    
    public function generatePerformanceReport(): array
    {
        return [
            'average_response_time' => $this->calculateAverageResponseTime(),
            'slow_queries_count' => $this->countSlowQueries(),
            'memory_usage_trend' => $this->calculateMemoryTrend(),
            'performance_grade' => $this->calculatePerformanceGrade(),
            'optimization_recommendations' => $this->generateOptimizationRecommendations()
        ];
    }
}
```
