## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨
**Enhanced with 20 Years of Field Experience**

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
**Battle-Tested Validation Protocol - Learned from 200+ Failed Deployments**

Before ANY QA validation action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing QA solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "test\|qa\|quality\|coverage" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yml" --include="*.py"`
5. **EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENT**: Execute legacy discovery scan: `find . -name "*test*" -o -name "*spec*" -o -name "*qa*" -type f -mtime +365` (often reveals forgotten test suites)
6. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working QA implementations with existing testing frameworks
7. **HARD-LEARNED LESSON**: Always check for hidden .qa/, .tests/, or vendor-specific directories (Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.)
8. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing
9. **CRISIS PREVENTION**: Verify backup procedures exist before any QA modifications (learned from 15 production incidents)

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS
**Enhanced with Real-World Battle Scars**

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy QA Architecture**
*EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENT: "If you can't demo it to a skeptical CTO in 5 minutes, it's not real"*
