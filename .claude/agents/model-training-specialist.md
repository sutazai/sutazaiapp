📌 Rule 11: Docker Excellence
/opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/diagrams
Strictly follow these here:
Docker Standards:

All Docker diagrams must include the complete directory structure
Reference these specific diagrams in /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/diagrams:

Dockerdiagram-core.md - Core container architecture
Dockerdiagram-self-coding.md - Self-coding service containers
Dockerdiagram-training.md - Training environment containers
Dockerdiagram.md - Main Docker architecture overview
PortRegistry.md - Port allocation and service registry


Every container architecture must follow the structure shown in /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/diagrams
All Docker configurations go in /docker/ but reference the diagrams for architecture decisions
Port assignments must follow PortRegistry.md specifications

✅ Required Practices:

All Docker configurations centralized in /docker/ directory only
Reference architecture diagrams in /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/diagrams before any container changes
Multi-stage Dockerfiles with development and production variants
Non-root user execution with proper USER directives (never run as root)
Pinned base image versions (never use latest tags)
Minimal base images (Alpine, distroless) for security and size
Comprehensive HEALTHCHECK instructions for all services
Proper .dockerignore files to optimize build context
Docker Compose files for each environment (dev/staging/prod)
Container vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
Secrets managed externally (never in images or ENV vars)
Resource limits and requests defined for all containers
Structured logging with proper log levels and formats
Container orchestration with proper service mesh integration

🚫 Forbidden Practices:

Creating Docker files outside /docker/ directory
Using latest or unpinned image tags in any environment
Running containers as root user without explicit security review
Storing secrets, credentials, or sensitive data in container images
Building images without vulnerability scanning and security validation
Creating monolithic containers that violate single responsibility principle
Using development configurations or debugging tools in production images
Implementing containers without proper health checks and monitoring
Creating containers without proper resource limits and quotas
Using containers that don't handle graceful shutdown (SIGTERM)

Validation Criteria:

All containers pass security scans with zero high-severity vulnerabilities
Docker configurations follow established patterns in /docker/ directory
Architecture decisions align with diagrams in /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/diagrams
Containers start reliably and handle graceful shutdown
Resource usage is optimized and within defined limits
All services have functional health checks and monitoring
Documentation is current and matches actual container behavior


📌 Rule 12: Universal Deployment Script
Requirement: Single ./deploy.sh script that provides zero-touch deployment capability across all environments with comprehensive automation, validation, and recovery mechanisms.
CRITICAL: Complete End-to-End Automation - One Command Does Everything:

Zero Interruption Deployment: Script must run from start to finish without ANY manual intervention
Complete System Setup: Must install, configure, and start the entire system to fully operational state
One Command Success: ./deploy.sh --env=prod results in complete running system - NO EXCEPTIONS
No Partial Deployments: Script either completes 100% successfully or rolls back completely
No Manual Steps: Zero requirement for human intervention during any phase of deployment
Full Stack Deployment: Database, backend, frontend, networking, monitoring - everything operational
Production Ready: System must be serving traffic and fully functional at script completion
No Post-Deployment Tasks: No additional configuration, setup, or manual steps required
Complete Validation: Script validates entire system is operational before declaring success
Zero Mistakes Tolerance: Any error triggers automatic rollback to previous state

CRITICAL: Complete Self-Sufficiency - Auto-Install Everything:

Dependency Detection: Automatically detect all missing tools, packages, and dependencies
Auto-Installation: Install all missing prerequisites without user intervention
Platform Intelligence: Detect OS and use appropriate package managers (apt, yum, brew, apk, etc.)
Version Validation: Ensure installed versions meet minimum requirements for deployment
Tool Chain Setup: Install complete toolchain (Docker, Git, curl, wget, systemctl, etc.)
Runtime Installation: Install all required runtimes (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.) with correct versions
Database Installation: Install and configure required databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)

📌 Rule 20: MCP Server Protection - Critical Infrastructure Safeguarding
Requirement: Implement absolute protection and preservation of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers as mission-critical infrastructure components, with comprehensive investigation procedures, automated monitoring, rigorous change control, and emergency response protocols to ensure continuous availability and functionality of essential AI-system integrations.
MISSION-CRITICAL: Absolute MCP Infrastructure Protection - Zero Tolerance for Unauthorized Changes:

Absolute Protection: MCP servers are protected infrastructure that must never be modified without explicit user authorization
Comprehensive Investigation: All MCP issues must be thoroughly investigated and documented before any action is taken
Proactive Monitoring: Continuous monitoring and health checking of all MCP server components and configurations
Emergency Procedures: Established emergency procedures for MCP server failures that prioritize restoration over removal
Change Control: Rigorous change control procedures specifically designed for MCP server infrastructure
Knowledge Preservation: Comprehensive documentation and knowledge management for all MCP server configurations
Team Training: Mandatory training for all team members on MCP server protection and management procedures
Business Continuity: MCP server protection ensures business continuity and AI system functionality

✅ Required Practices:
Absolute MCP Server Protection Standards:
Mandatory Protection Requirements:

Zero Unauthorized Changes: No modifications to MCP servers, configurations, or wrapper scripts without explicit user permission
Preservation First: Always preserve existing MCP server integrations when making any system changes
Investigation Over Removal: Investigate and report MCP issues rather than removing or disabling servers
Configuration Immutability: Treat .mcp.json and wrapper scripts as immutable without explicit authorization
Integration Preservation: Ensure all system changes maintain MCP server functionality and integration
Backup and Recovery: Maintain comprehensive backups and recovery procedures for all MCP configurations
Access Control: Implement strict access controls and audit trails for MCP server administration
Change Documentation: Document all authorized MCP changes with comprehensive rationale and approval
