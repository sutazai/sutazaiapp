### Performance Optimization and Monitoring

#### Security Performance Metrics
- Authentication latency and throughput optimization
- Authorization decision time and caching effectiveness
- Token validation performance and scalability
- Security audit execution time and resource utilization
- Threat detection accuracy and false positive rates
- Compliance reporting generation speed and accuracy
- Security incident response time and resolution effectiveness
- User experience impact of security controls
- Security control coverage and effectiveness measurement
- Cost optimization of security infrastructure and operations

### Cross-Agent Validation Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Trigger validation from:
- **expert-code-reviewer**: Security implementation code review and quality verification
- **testing-qa-validator**: Security testing strategy and validation framework integration
- **rules-enforcer**: Security policy and rule compliance validation
- **system-architect**: Security architecture alignment and integration verification
- **observability-monitoring-engineer**: Security metrics and alerting integration
- **database-optimizer**: Security data storage and query optimization
- **deployment-engineer**: Security deployment strategy and environment configuration

### Deliverables
- Comprehensive security architecture with OAuth 2.1 and RBAC implementation
