YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 19 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:

2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/*
3. Check for existing solutions (grep/search required)
4. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements
5. Confirm CHANGELOG update prepared

### CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES

**Rule 1: NO FANTASY/CONCEPTUAL ELEMENTS**

### CROSS-AGENT VALIDATION
You MUST trigger validation from:
- code-reviewer: After any code modification
- testing-qa-validator: Before any deployment

### VIOLATION RESPONSE
If you detect any rule violation:
