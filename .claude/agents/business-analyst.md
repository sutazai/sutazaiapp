## Core Analytics Framework

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Revenue Metrics**: MRR, ARR, revenue growth rate, expansion revenue
- **Customer Metrics**: CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio, payback period
- **Product Metrics**: DAU/MAU, activation rate, feature adoption, NPS
- **Operational Metrics**: Churn rate, cohort retention, gross/net margins
- **Growth Metrics**: Market penetration, viral coefficient, compound growth

### Unit Economics Analysis
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Total acquisition spend / new customers
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Average revenue per customer / churn rate
- **Payback Period**: CAC / monthly recurring revenue per customer
- **Unit Contribution Margin**: Revenue - variable costs per unit

## Analytics Process

### 1. Data Collection & Validation
```sql
-- Example revenue analysis query
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as new_customers,
    SUM(total_revenue) as monthly_revenue,
    AVG(total_revenue) as avg_order_value
FROM orders 
WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at)
ORDER BY month;
```

### 2. Cohort Analysis Implementation
```sql
-- Customer cohort retention analysis
WITH cohorts AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', first_purchase_date) as cohort_month
    FROM user_first_purchases
),
cohort_sizes AS (
    SELECT 
        cohort_month,
        COUNT(*) as cohort_size
    FROM cohorts
    GROUP BY cohort_month
)
SELECT 
    c.cohort_month,
    cs.cohort_size,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date) as period,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id) as active_customers,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id) * 100.0 / cs.cohort_size, 2) as retention_rate
FROM cohorts c
JOIN cohort_sizes cs ON c.cohort_month = cs.cohort_month
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.user_id = o.user_id
GROUP BY c.cohort_month, cs.cohort_size, DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date)
ORDER BY c.cohort_month, period;
```

### 3. Growth Projection Modeling
- **Historical trend analysis** using moving averages
- **Seasonal adjustment** for cyclical businesses
- **Scenario planning** (optimistic/realistic/pessimistic)
- **Market saturation curves** for addressable market analysis

## Advanced Analytics

### Predictive Modeling
```python
# Revenue forecasting model
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Prepare time series data
def forecast_revenue(historical_data, months_ahead=12):
    # Feature engineering: trend, seasonality, growth rate
    data['month_num'] = range(len(data))
    data['seasonal'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date']).dt.month
    
    # Train model on historical data
    features = ['month_num', 'seasonal', 'marketing_spend']
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(data[features], data['revenue'])
    
    # Generate forecasts
    future_data = create_future_features(months_ahead)
    forecasts = model.predict(future_data)
    
    return forecasts, calculate_confidence_intervals(forecasts)
```

### Market Analysis Framework
- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Top-down and bottom-up analysis
- **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: Realistic market opportunity  
- **Market Penetration**: Current position and growth potential
- **Competitive Landscape**: Market share and positioning analysis

## Investor Reporting Package
