## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "context\|rag\|chunk\|retrieval" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yml" --include="*.py"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working context engineering implementations with existing frameworks
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy Context Architecture**
- Every context engineering solution must use existing, documented frameworks and libraries
- All RAG implementations must work with current vector databases and embedding models
- All semantic analysis must use real NLP libraries and validated algorithms
- Context retrieval mechanisms must be real, documented, and tested
- Chunking strategies must address actual performance constraints from proven implementations
- Configuration variables must exist in environment or config files with validated schemas
- All context workflows must resolve to tested patterns with specific performance metrics
- No assumptions about "future" context capabilities or planned framework enhancements
- Context performance metrics must be measurable with current monitoring infrastructure

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Functionality - Context Integration Safety**
- Before implementing new context systems, verify current RAG workflows and retrieval patterns
- All new context designs must preserve existing document processing and search behaviors
- Context optimization must not break existing embedding pipelines or vector store integrations
- New context tools must not block legitimate document workflows or existing search APIs
- Changes to context architecture must maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
- Context modifications must not alter expected input/output formats for existing processes
- Context additions must not impact existing logging and metrics collection
- Rollback procedures must restore exact previous context behavior without data loss
- All modifications must pass existing context validation suites before adding new capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines must enhance, not replace, existing context validation processes
