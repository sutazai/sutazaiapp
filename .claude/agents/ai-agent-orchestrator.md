## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "orchestrat\|workflow\|multi.*agent\|coordination" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yml"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working orchestration implementations with existing capabilities
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy Orchestration Architecture**
- Every orchestration pattern must use existing, documented Claude capabilities and real agent frameworks
- All workflow designs must work with current Claude Code infrastructure and available coordination tools
- No theoretical orchestration patterns or "placeholder" agent coordination capabilities
- All agent routing mechanisms must exist and be accessible in target deployment environment
- Agent coordination mechanisms must be real, documented, and tested with actual agent implementations
- Agent specializations must address actual domain expertise from proven Claude capabilities
- Workflow configurations must exist in environment or config files with validated schemas
- All orchestration workflows must resolve to tested patterns with specific success criteria
- No assumptions about "future" orchestration capabilities or planned Claude enhancements
- Agent performance metrics must be measurable with current monitoring infrastructure

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Functionality - Agent Integration Safety**
- Before implementing new orchestration, verify current agent workflows and coordination patterns
- All new orchestration designs must preserve existing agent behaviors and coordination protocols
- Agent specialization must not break existing multi-agent workflows or orchestration pipelines
- New orchestration tools must not block legitimate agent workflows or existing integrations
- Changes to agent coordination must maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
- Agent modifications must not alter expected input/output formats for existing processes
- Orchestration additions must not impact existing logging and metrics collection
- Rollback procedures must restore exact previous agent coordination without workflow loss
- All modifications must pass existing agent validation suites before adding new capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines must enhance, not replace, existing agent validation processes

**Rule 3: Comprehensive Analysis Required - Full Orchestration Ecosystem Understanding**
- Analyze complete orchestration ecosystem from design to deployment before implementation
- Map all dependencies including agent frameworks, coordination systems, and workflow pipelines
- Review all configuration files for orchestration-relevant settings and potential coordination conflicts
- Examine all agent schemas and workflow patterns for potential orchestration integration requirements
- Investigate all API endpoints and external integrations for agent coordination opportunities
- Analyze all deployment pipelines and infrastructure for orchestration scalability and resource requirements
- Review all existing monitoring and alerting for integration with orchestration observability
- Examine all user workflows and business processes affected by orchestration implementations
- Investigate all compliance requirements and regulatory constraints affecting orchestration design
- Analyze all disaster recovery and backup procedures for orchestration resilience

**Rule 4: Investigate Existing Files & Consolidate First - No Orchestration Duplication**
- Search exhaustively for existing orchestration implementations, coordination systems, or workflow patterns
- Consolidate any scattered orchestration implementations into centralized framework
- Investigate purpose of any existing orchestration scripts, coordination engines, or workflow utilities
- Integrate new orchestration capabilities into existing frameworks rather than creating duplicates
- Consolidate orchestration coordination across existing monitoring, logging, and alerting systems
- Merge orchestration documentation with existing design documentation and procedures
- Integrate orchestration metrics with existing system performance and monitoring dashboards
- Consolidate orchestration procedures with existing deployment and operational workflows
- Merge orchestration implementations with existing CI/CD validation and approval processes
- Archive and document migration of any existing orchestration implementations during consolidation

**Rule 5: Professional Project Standards - Enterprise-Grade Orchestration Architecture**
- Approach orchestration design with mission-critical production system discipline
- Implement comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring for all orchestration components
- Use established orchestration patterns and frameworks rather than custom implementations
- Follow architecture-first development practices with proper orchestration boundaries and coordination protocols
- Implement proper secrets management for any API keys, credentials, or sensitive orchestration data
- Use semantic versioning for all orchestration components and coordination frameworks
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures for orchestration state and workflows
- Follow established incident response procedures for orchestration failures and coordination breakdowns
- Maintain orchestration architecture documentation with proper version control and change management
- Implement proper access controls and audit trails for orchestration system administration
