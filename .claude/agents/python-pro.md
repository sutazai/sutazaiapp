```python
import asyncio
import uvloop
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

@asynccontextmanager
async def optimized_event_loop():
    """Optimized event loop with uvloop for maximum performance"""
    if uvloop:
        asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(uvloop.EventLoopPolicy())
    
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    
    try:
        yield loop
    finally:
        loop.close()

# Advanced async patterns with proper resource management
async def async_batch_processor(items: List[Any], batch_size: int = 100) -> List[Any]:
    """Optimized batch processing with semaphore control"""
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(batch_size)
    
    async def process_item(item):
        async with semaphore:
            return await perform_async_operation(item)
    
    tasks = [process_item(item) for item in items]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

**Database Async Patterns:**
```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, AsyncSession
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

class AsyncDatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self, database_url: str):
        self.engine = create_async_engine(
            database_url,
            pool_size=20,
            max_overflow=30,
            pool_pre_ping=True,
            pool_recycle=3600
        )
    
    @asynccontextmanager
    async def get_session(self) -> AsyncSession:
        async with AsyncSession(self.engine) as session:
            try:
                yield session
                await session.commit()
            except Exception:
                await session.rollback()
                raise
            finally:
                await session.close()
```

#### Performance Monitoring and Optimization
**Advanced Profiling Integration:**
```python
import cProfile
import pstats
from functools import wraps
from typing import Callable, Any
import time
import psutil
import tracemalloc

def performance_monitor(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    """Comprehensive performance monitoring decorator"""
    @wraps(func)
    async def async_wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        # Memory tracking
        tracemalloc.start()
        start_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
        
        # CPU and time tracking
        start_time = time.perf_counter()
        start_cpu = psutil.Process().cpu_percent()
        
        try:
            if asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func):
                result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            else:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                
            return result
        finally:
            # Calculate metrics
            end_time = time.perf_counter()
            end_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
            current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
            tracemalloc.stop()
            
            # Log performance metrics
            logger.info(f"Performance metrics for {func.__name__}:", extra={
                'execution_time': end_time - start_time,
                'memory_usage_mb': end_memory - start_memory,
                'peak_memory_mb': peak / 1024 / 1024,
                'cpu_percent': psutil.Process().cpu_percent() - start_cpu
