  const memoizedData = useMemo(() => {
    return data
      .filter(item => filters.every(filter => filter(item)))
      .map(item => ({
        ...item,
        computed: expensiveComputation(item),
        formatted: formatData(item)
      }));
  }, [data, filters]);

  const handleUpdate = useCallback((id, updates) => {
    onUpdate(id, updates);
  }, [onUpdate]);

  return (
    <VirtualizedList
      items={memoizedData}
      onUpdate={handleUpdate}
      renderItem={MemoizedItem}
    />
  );
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Custom comparison for complex prop structures
  return (
    prevProps.data === nextProps.data &&
    prevProps.filters.length === nextProps.filters.length &&
    prevProps.filters.every((filter, index) => filter === nextProps.filters[index])
  );
});
```

**Advanced Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:**
```javascript
// Route-based code splitting with preloading
const Dashboard = lazy(() => 
  import(/* webpackChunkName: "dashboard" */ './pages/Dashboard')
);

const Reports = lazy(() => 
  import(/* webpackChunkName: "reports" */ './pages/Reports')
);

// Component-level lazy loading with intersection observer
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
      if (entries[0].isIntersecting) {
        observer.disconnect();
        resolve(import('./HeavyComponent'));
      }
    });
    
    observer.observe(document.querySelector('#lazy-component-trigger'));
  });
});

// Resource preloading for anticipated navigation
const preloadRoute = (routeName) => {
  const routeMap = {
    dashboard: () => import('./pages/Dashboard'),
    reports: () => import('./pages/Reports')
  };
  
  if (routeMap[routeName]) {
    routeMap[routeName]();
  }
};
```

**Memory Leak Prevention and Cleanup:**
```javascript
const useOptimizedEffect = (effect, deps, cleanup) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const timeouts = new Set();
    const intervals = new Set();
    
    const optimizedCleanup = () => {
      controller.abort();
      timeouts.forEach(clearTimeout);
      intervals.forEach(clearInterval);
      cleanup?.();
    };
    
    effect({
      signal: controller.signal,
      setTimeout: (fn, delay) => {
        const id = setTimeout(fn, delay);
        timeouts.add(id);
        return id;
      },
      setInterval: (fn, delay) => {
        const id = setInterval(fn, delay);
        intervals.add(id);
        return id;
      }
    });
    
    return optimizedCleanup;
  }, deps);
};

// Usage with automatic cleanup
const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  
  useOptimizedEffect(
    ({ signal, setTimeout }) => {
      fetchData(signal).then(setData);
      
      // Auto-cleanup polling
      setTimeout(() => {
        fetchData(signal).then(setData);
      }, 5000);
    },
    [],
    () => {
      // Additional cleanup logic
      console.log('Component cleanup executed');
    }
  );
  
  return <DataDisplay data={data} />;
};
```

#### Real-Time Performance Monitoring
```javascript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  constructor() {
    this.metrics = new Map();
    this.thresholds = {
      renderTime: 16, // 60fps target
      bundleSize: 250000, // 250KB max
      memoryUsage: 50000000, // 50MB max
      apiResponseTime: 1000 // 1s max
    };
  }

  measureRenderPerformance(componentName) {
    return (WrappedComponent) => {
      return (props) => {
        const startTime = performance.now();
        
        useEffect(() => {
          const endTime = performance.now();
          const renderTime = endTime - startTime;
          
          this.recordMetric('renderTime', componentName, renderTime);
          
          if (renderTime > this.thresholds.renderTime) {
            this.alertSlowRender(componentName, renderTime);
          }
        });
        
        return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
      };
    };
  }

  measureMemoryUsage() {
    if ('memory' in performance) {
      const memory = performance.memory;
      this.recordMetric('memoryUsage', 'global', memory.usedJSHeapSize);
      
      if (memory.usedJSHeapSize > this.thresholds.memoryUsage) {
        this.alertHighMemoryUsage(memory);
      }
    }
  }

  measureCoreWebVitals() {
    // Largest Contentful Paint
    new PerformanceObserver((entryList) => {
      const entries = entryList.getEntries();
      const lastEntry = entries[entries.length - 1];
      this.recordMetric('LCP', 'global', lastEntry.startTime);
    }).observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint'] });

    // First Input Delay
    new PerformanceObserver((entryList) => {
      const entries = entryList.getEntries();
      entries.forEach((entry) => {
        this.recordMetric('FID', 'global', entry.processingStart - entry.startTime);
      });
    }).observe({ entryTypes: ['first-input'] });

    // Cumulative Layout Shift
    new PerformanceObserver((entryList) => {
      const entries = entryList.getEntries();
      entries.forEach((entry) => {
        if (!entry.hadRecentInput) {
          this.recordMetric('CLS', 'global', entry.value);
        }
      });
    }).observe({ entryTypes: ['layout-shift'] });
  }
}
```
