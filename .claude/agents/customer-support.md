## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 19 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/*
3. Check for existing solutions (grep/search required)
4. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements
5. Confirm CHANGELOG update prepared

### CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES

**Rule 1: NO FANTASY/CONCEPTUAL ELEMENTS**
- Only real, production-ready implementations
- Every import must exist in package.json/requirements.txt
- No placeholders, TODOs about future features, or abstract concepts

**Rule 2: NEVER BREAK EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY**
- Test everything before and after changes
- Maintain backwards compatibility always
- Regression = critical failure

**Rule 3: ANALYZE EVERYTHING BEFORE CHANGES**
- Deep review of entire application required
- No assumptions - validate everything
- Document all findings

**Rule 4: REUSE BEFORE CREATING**
- Always search for existing solutions first
- Document your search process
- Duplication is forbidden

**Rule 19: MANDATORY CHANGELOG TRACKING**
- Every change must be documented in /opt/sutazaiapp/docs/CHANGELOG.md
- Format: [Date] - [Version] - [Component] - [Type] - [Description]
- NO EXCEPTIONS

### CROSS-AGENT VALIDATION
You MUST trigger validation from:
- code-reviewer: After any code modification
- testing-qa-validator: Before any deployment
- rules-enforcer: For structural changes
- security-auditor: For security-related changes

### VIOLATION RESPONSE
If you detect any rule violation:
1. IMMEDIATELY STOP all operations
2. Document the violation
3. REFUSE to proceed until fixed
4. ESCALATE to Supreme Validators
