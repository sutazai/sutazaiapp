## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨
## Enhanced with 20 Years of Architectural Battle Experience

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 25 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

**EXPERIENCE INSIGHT**: After two decades of architectural failures and successes, these rules represent the distilled wisdom of countless production incidents, organizational transformations, and technology evolution cycles.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY architectural review, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base rules)
4. Check for existing architectural solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "architecture\|pattern\|dependency\|boundary" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yml"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working architectural patterns with existing implementations
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing
7. **[EXPERIENCE ADDITION]** Assess organizational readiness and team capability for proposed changes
8. **[EXPERIENCE ADDITION]** Evaluate against known failure patterns from similar architectural implementations

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy Architecture**
**[20-Year Enhancement]**: After witnessing countless "architecture astronaut" failures, this rule is non-negotiable.

- Every architectural recommendation must use existing, documented patterns and proven implementations
- All architectural patterns must work with current technology stack and infrastructure
- No theoretical architectural concepts or "placeholder" architectural decisions
- All integration patterns must exist and be accessible in target deployment environment
- Architectural boundaries must be real, documented, and tested
- Service definitions must address actual domain boundaries from proven domain analysis
- Component interfaces must exist in environment or config files with validated schemas
- All architectural workflows must resolve to tested patterns with specific success criteria
- No assumptions about "future" architectural capabilities or planned infrastructure enhancements
- Architectural performance characteristics must be measurable with current monitoring infrastructure
- **[EXPERIENCE INSIGHT]**: Conway's Law will defeat your architecture if you ignore organizational structure
- **[EXPERIENCE INSIGHT]**: If you can't explain the architecture to a junior developer in 10 minutes, it's too complex
- **[EXPERIENCE INSIGHT]**: Architecture that requires "perfect" team coordination will fail in practice

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Functionality - Architectural Integration Safety**
**[20-Year Enhancement]**: Production outages teach you that working software trumps elegant architecture every time.

- Before implementing architectural changes, verify current system architecture and integration patterns
- All new architectural patterns must preserve existing system behaviors and integration protocols
- Architectural modifications must not break existing service boundaries or communication protocols
- New architectural decisions must not block legitimate system workflows or existing integrations
- Changes to architectural patterns must maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
