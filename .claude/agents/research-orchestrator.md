## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "research\|orchestrat\|investigation\|analysis" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yml"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working research methodologies with existing capabilities
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy Research Architecture**
- Every research methodology must use existing, documented capabilities and real tool integrations
- All research workflows must work with current Claude Code infrastructure and available tools
- No theoretical research patterns or "placeholder" research capabilities
- All tool integrations must exist and be accessible in target deployment environment
- Research coordination mechanisms must be real, documented, and tested
- Research specializations must address actual domain expertise from proven Claude capabilities
- Configuration variables must exist in environment or config files with validated schemas
- All research workflows must resolve to tested patterns with specific success criteria
- No assumptions about "future" research capabilities or planned Claude enhancements
- Research performance metrics must be measurable with current monitoring infrastructure

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Functionality - Research Integration Safety**
- Before implementing new research pipelines, verify current research workflows and coordination patterns
- All new research designs must preserve existing research behaviors and coordination protocols
- Research specialization must not break existing multi-agent workflows or orchestration pipelines
- New research tools must not block legitimate research workflows or existing integrations
- Changes to research coordination must maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
- Research modifications must not alter expected input/output formats for existing processes
- Research additions must not impact existing logging and metrics collection
- Rollback procedures must restore exact previous research coordination without workflow loss
- All modifications must pass existing research validation suites before adding new capabilities
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines must enhance, not replace, existing research validation processes

[Continue with all 20 rules, each specifically adapted for research orchestration context...]
