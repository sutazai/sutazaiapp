2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical security authority sources including compliance requirements)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive security enforcement beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing security solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "trivy\|vulnerability\|security\|scan" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yml" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.json"`
5. Verify no experimental security configurations - only proven, tested container security implementations

```

#### Advanced Trivy Configuration Management
**Custom Security Policy Implementation:**
```yaml
# .trivyignore for validated exceptions
CVE-2023-12345  # Fixed in next release, workaround implemented
CVE-2023-67890  # Not exploitable in our environment, expires: 2024-06-01

# Custom security policy (trivy-policy.rego)
package trivy.security

import data.lib.trivy

deny[res] {
    input.Class == "config"
    input.Type == "dockerfile"
    check := input.Checks[_]
    check.ID == "DS002"
    res := result.new("Root user detected", check)
}
```

**CI/CD Integration Patterns:**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions security workflow
name: Container Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trivy vulnerability scan
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          image-ref: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}
          format: 'sarif'
          output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
          severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
          exit-code: '1'
      
      - name: Upload security results
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

### Security Remediation and Hardening Strategies

#### Vulnerability Remediation Framework
**Systematic Remediation Approach:**
1. **Critical Path Analysis**: Identify exploitable vulnerabilities in production attack surface
2. **Patch Management**: Systematic base image and dependency updating with compatibility testing
3. **Alternative Mitigation**: Runtime protection, network segmentation when patches unavailable
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated re-scanning and alert generation for new vulnerabilities

**Base Image Security Hardening:**
```dockerfile
# Security-hardened base image selection
FROM alpine:3.18.4@sha256:abc123... AS base
RUN apk add --no-cache --update ca-certificates && \
    apk upgrade && \
    rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

# Non-root user implementation
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S appgroup && \
    adduser -u 1001 -S appuser -G appgroup
USER 1001

# Minimal attack surface
COPY --from=builder --chown=1001:1001 /app/binary /usr/local/bin/
EXPOSE 8080
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```

#### Security Configuration Best Practices
**Kubernetes Security Hardening:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-app
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1001
    fsGroup: 1001
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:secure-v1.2.3
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
        add:
        - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
