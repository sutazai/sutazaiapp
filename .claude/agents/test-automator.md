import { UserService } from '../UserService';
import { ApiClient } from '../ApiClient';

// Mock dependencies
jest.mock('../ApiClient');
const mockApiClient = ApiClient as jest.Mocked<typeof ApiClient>;

describe('UserService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  describe('getUserById', () => {
    it('should return user data when API call succeeds', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '123';
      const expectedUser = { id: '123', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' };
      mockApiClient.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: expectedUser });

      // Act
      const result = await UserService.getUserById(userId);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual(expectedUser);
      expect(mockApiClient.get).toHaveBeenCalledWith(`/users/${userId}`);
    });

    it('should throw error when user not found', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '999';
      mockApiClient.get.mockRejectedValue(new Error('User not found'));

      // Act & Assert
      await expect(UserService.getUserById(userId)).rejects.toThrow('User not found');
    });
  });
});
```

#### Integration Test Template (Playwright)
```javascript
// user-management.e2e.js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('User Management', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/login');
    await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', 'admin@example.com');
    await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'password123');
    await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]');
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
  });

  test('should create new user successfully', async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to user creation page
    await page.click('[data-testid="users-menu"]');
    await page.click('[data-testid="create-user-button"]');

    // Fill user form
    await page.fill('[data-testid="user-name"]', 'Jane Smith');
    await page.fill('[data-testid="user-email"]', 'jane.smith@example.com');
    await page.selectOption('[data-testid="user-role"]', 'editor');

    // Submit form
    await page.click('[data-testid="save-user-button"]');

    // Verify success
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="success-message"]')).toBeVisible();
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="user-list"]')).toContainText('Jane Smith');
  });
});
```

#### API Test Template (Postman/Newman)
```javascript
// user-api.test.js
const newman = require('newman');

describe('User API Tests', () => {
  test('should execute user management API collection', (done) => {
    newman.run({
      collection: './tests/api/user-management.postman_collection.json',
      environment: './tests/api/test.postman_environment.json',
      reporters: ['cli', 'json'],
      reporter: {
        json: {
          export: './test-results/api-test-results.json'
        }
      }
    }, (err, summary) => {
      if (err) {
        done(err);
        return;
      }
      
      expect(summary.run.failures).toHaveLength(0);
      expect(summary.run.stats.assertions.failed).toBe(0);
      done();
    });
  });
});
```

#### Performance Test Template (k6)
```javascript
// load-test.js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 }, // Ramp up to 100 users
    { duration: '5m', target: 100 }, // Stay at 100 users
    { duration: '2m', target: 200 }, // Ramp up to 200 users
    { duration: '5m', target: 200 }, // Stay at 200 users
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },   // Ramp down to 0 users
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'], // 95% of requests must complete below 500ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],    // Error rate must be below 10%
  },
};

export default function () {
  const response = http.get('https://api.example.com/users');
  
  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
  });
  
  sleep(1);
}
