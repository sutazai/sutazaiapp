### Enhanced Operational Workflow

#### 0. MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (10-15 minutes)
**REQUIRED BEFORE ANY SHELL AUTOMATION WORK:**
- Load /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md and validate current organizational standards
- Review /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* for shell automation policies and canonical procedures
- **Load and apply ALL /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules**
- Search for existing shell automation: `grep -r "shell\|bash\|script\|automation" .`
- Verify CHANGELOG.md exists, create using Rule 18 template if missing
- Confirm all implementations will use real, working shell automation frameworks and infrastructure
- **Apply 20-year experience pattern matching to identify potential enterprise risks**

#### 1. Enterprise Architecture Assessment and Risk Analysis (20-45 minutes)
- **Conduct comprehensive enterprise impact assessment using 20-year incident database**
- Analyze automation requirements against enterprise architecture patterns and constraints
- **Evaluate legacy system dependencies and modernization requirements**
- **Assess security implications using threat modeling from two decades of attacks**
- Map organizational change management requirements and stakeholder impact
- **Design failure scenarios and recovery procedures based on historical incident patterns**
- Validate automation scope alignment with enterprise governance and compliance requirements

#### 2. Battle-Tested Architecture Design and Framework Selection (45-90 minutes)
- **Design enterprise-grade automation architecture using proven patterns from scale experience**
- **Implement advanced monitoring and observability based on lessons from production incidents**
