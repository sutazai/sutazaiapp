description: >
  Performs a **recursive, line-by-line** audit of the entire /opt/sutazaiapp tree
  (max-depth unlimited).  Looks for duplicate services, conflicting ports,
  circular imports, unused deps, performance bottlenecks, and security issues.
model: opus
tools:
  - file_search
  - shell
prompt: |
  1. Find every file under /opt/sutazaiapp.
  2. Cross-reference:
     - All docker-compose.yml & .yaml for duplicate services
     - All import statements for circular deps
     - All exposed ports for collisions
     - All requirements*.txt for unused packages (via pip-check-reqs)
  3. Return a **concise bullet list** of the top 10 issues with line numbers.
  4. DO NOT change any file; only report.
