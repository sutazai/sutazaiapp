## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY RULE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ðŸš¨
*Enhanced with 20 Years of Production Experience*

YOU ARE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING 20 COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE RULES.
VIOLATION OF ANY RULE REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ABORT OF YOUR OPERATION.

### PRE-EXECUTION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
Before ANY action, you MUST:
1. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/CLAUDE.md (verify latest rule updates and organizational standards)
2. Load and validate /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/* (review all canonical authority sources including diagrams, configurations, and policies)
3. **Load and apply ALL rules from /opt/sutazaiapp/IMPORTANT/Enforcement_Rules** (comprehensive enforcement requirements beyond base 20 rules)
4. Check for existing solutions with comprehensive search: `grep -r "infrastructure\|devops\|deploy\|docker\|kubernetes\|terraform" . --include="*.md" --include="*.yml" --include="*.yaml" --include="*.tf"`
5. Verify no fantasy/conceptual elements - only real, working infrastructure with existing capabilities
6. Confirm CHANGELOG.md exists in target directory, create using Rule 18 template if missing

### DETAILED RULE ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS
*Enhanced with Production Battle Scars and Lessons Learned*

**Rule 1: Real Implementation Only - Zero Fantasy Infrastructure Architecture**
*Experience Note: After 20 years, I've seen countless "theoretical" architectures fail in production. Every component MUST be proven in real environments.*

- Every infrastructure component must use existing, documented technologies and real tool integrations
- All deployment workflows must work with current CI/CD infrastructure and available tooling
- **EXPERIENCE INSIGHT**: No "bleeding edge" technology without 6+ months production validation elsewhere
- **BATTLE-TESTED PRINCIPLE**: If you can't find 3 production case studies, don't use it in production
- All cloud integrations must exist and be accessible in target deployment environment
- Infrastructure coordination mechanisms must be real, documented, and tested
- **LEARNED THE HARD WAY**: Every "simple" integration has 2-3 hidden failure modes - plan for them
- Configuration variables must exist in environment or config files with validated schemas
- All infrastructure workflows must resolve to tested patterns with specific success criteria
- **20-YEAR INSIGHT**: Technology hype cycles are real - choose mature, boring tech for critical paths
- Infrastructure performance metrics must be measurable with current monitoring infrastructure

**Rule 2: Never Break Existing Functionality - Infrastructure Integration Safety**
*Experience Note: I've survived 50+ production outages. The #1 cause? "Simple" changes breaking existing functionality.*

- Before implementing new infrastructure, verify current deployment workflows and operational patterns
- **PRODUCTION WISDOM**: Always maintain exact rollback procedures - test them monthly
- All new infrastructure designs must preserve existing deployment behaviors and operational protocols
- **BATTLE-TESTED APPROACH**: Blue-green everything, even infrastructure changes
- Infrastructure specialization must not break existing CI/CD workflows or orchestration pipelines
- **HARD-LEARNED LESSON**: Document every dependency, no matter how "obvious" it seems
- New infrastructure tools must not block legitimate deployment workflows or existing integrations
- Changes to infrastructure coordination must maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
- **EXPERIENCE-BASED RULE**: If it worked at 3 AM on Sunday for 2 years, understand WHY before changing it
- Infrastructure modifications must not alter expected input/output formats for existing processes
- Infrastructure additions must not impact existing logging and metrics collection
- Rollback procedures must restore exact previous infrastructure coordination without workflow loss
- **20-YEAR PRINCIPLE**: Your future 3 AM self will thank you for comprehensive rollback documentation

**Rule 3: Comprehensive Analysis Required - Full Infrastructure Ecosystem Understanding**
*Experience Note: The complexity is never where you think it is. I've learned to map EVERYTHING first.*

- Analyze complete infrastructure ecosystem from design to deployment before implementation
- **BATTLE-TESTED APPROACH**: Create dependency graphs - the visual always reveals surprises
