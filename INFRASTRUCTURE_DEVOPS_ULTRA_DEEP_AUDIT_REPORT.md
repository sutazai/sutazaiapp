RESTARTING CONTAINERS (1):
- sutazai-jarvis-hardware-resource-optimizer (Missing psutil dependency)
```

### Resource Utilization Analysis
- **Total Memory Usage:** 1.89GB across 16 containers
- **CPU Usage:** Generally low (0.00% - 0.64% per container)
- **Memory Pressure Points:**
  - Ollama: 769MB (38% of 2GB limit) - Largest consumer
  - Neo4j: 493MB (48% of 1GB limit) - Approaching limit
  - Grafana: 138MB (27% of 512MB limit) - Acceptable
  - RabbitMQ: 130MB (0.54% of 23GB limit) - Over-provisioned

---

## 🔧 CONTAINER RESTART LOOP ANALYSIS

### Critical Issue: jarvis-hardware-resource-optimizer
```
ERROR: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psutil'
IMPACT: Container cannot start, affecting hardware optimization features
ROOT CAUSE: Dockerfile installs dependencies but psutil is missing from requirements.txt
REPRODUCTION: Container has psutil>=5.9.0 in requirements but build fails
```

**Immediate Fix Required:**
```dockerfile
# Fix in /opt/sutazaiapp/agents/jarvis-hardware-resource-optimizer/Dockerfile
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir psutil>=5.9.0
```

### Secondary Issue: hardware-resource-optimizer (Unhealthy)
```
ERROR: Docker client unavailable: Permission denied
IMPACT: Hardware optimization agent cannot access Docker daemon
ROOT CAUSE: Container runs as non-root but needs Docker socket access
```

**Security vs Functionality Conflict:** Container designed for security (non-root) but requires privileged access for hardware optimization.

## 🔐 SECURITY AUDIT FINDINGS

### Secrets Management - MIXED STATE
```
SECURE SECRET STORAGE: /opt/sutazaiapp/secrets_secure/
✅ 14 secret files with proper permissions (600)
✅ Non-root group ownership (opt-admins)
✅ Separate secure directory structure

SECURITY CONCERNS:
⚠️  Hardcoded passwords in .env file (world-readable)
⚠️  Mixed root/non-root Docker configurations
⚠️  Container privilege escalation requirements
⚠️  Docker socket mounting for hardware optimization
```

### Container Security Analysis
**Non-root Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **Secure Containers:** Frontend, most agent services
- ❌ **Root Containers:** Hardware optimizers (require privileged access)
- ⚠️ **Mixed Permissions:** Inconsistent security posture

### Network Security
- **Bridge Network:** sutazai-network (172.18.0.0/16)
- **Container Isolation:** Properly isolated within Docker network
- **Port Exposure:** All services properly bound to specific ports
- **Service Mesh:** Partially configured (Kong/Consul not running)

---

## 🌐 NETWORKING & SERVICE DISCOVERY

### Service Mesh Status: PARTIALLY CONFIGURED
```
Kong API Gateway: DEFINED but NOT RUNNING
- Port 10005/10015 allocated but service down
- Configuration exists: /opt/sutazaiapp/config/kong/kong.yml
- 40+ service routes defined but inactive

Consul Service Discovery: DEFINED but NOT RUNNING  
- Port 10006 allocated but service down
- Would provide service registration/discovery
- Currently services use direct DNS resolution
```

### Network Architecture
- **DNS Resolution:** Container-to-container via Docker DNS
- **Load Balancing:** Not implemented (Kong down)
- **Service Registry:** Static configuration only
- **Health Checks:** Individual container health checks working

# Or rebuild with fixed Dockerfile:
cd /opt/sutazaiapp/agents/jarvis-hardware-resource-optimizer
docker build -t jarvis-hardware-resource-optimizer .
docker-compose restart jarvis-hardware-resource-optimizer
```

### 2. Service Mesh Activation (HIGH)
```bash
# Start Kong API Gateway
docker-compose up -d kong consul

curl http://localhost:10005/status
curl http://localhost:10006/v1/status/leader
```

### 3. Resource Optimization (MEDIUM)
```bash
# Reduce Neo4j memory pressure
docker-compose exec neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p ${NEO4J_PASSWORD} "CALL dbms.procedures() YIELD name WHERE name CONTAINS 'gc' RETURN name;"

# Monitor Ollama memory usage
docker stats --no-stream sutazai-ollama
```

### 4. Security Hardening (HIGH)
```bash
# Fix hardcoded passwords in .env
chmod 600 /opt/sutazaiapp/.env

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

The SutazAI infrastructure demonstrates **solid architectural fundamentals** but suffers from **over-engineering and operational complexity**. The core services (16/59) are healthy and performant, with excellent monitoring coverage. However, the system requires immediate attention to container dependency issues and activation of the service mesh to achieve full operational capability.

### Key Strengths
- ✅ Robust monitoring and observability stack
- ✅ Proper data persistence and backup strategies  
- ✅ Good security fundamentals with secrets management
- ✅ Comprehensive alerting and health checks
- ✅ Strong DevOps automation and deployment scripts

### Critical Improvements Needed
- 🔧 Fix container dependency and restart issues (IMMEDIATE)
- 🔧 Activate service mesh for proper load balancing (THIS WEEK)
- 🔧 Consolidate 200+ Docker configurations (THIS MONTH)
- 🔧 Implement dynamic resource scaling (NEXT QUARTER)

**Overall Assessment:** OPERATIONAL with CRITICAL ISSUES requiring immediate attention. The system is production-capable once container stability issues are resolved and the service mesh is activated.
