# Claude Task Runner Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps for implementing and testing the Claude Task Runner proof of concept.

## Overview

The Claude Task Runner is a tool for managing context isolation and focused task execution with Claude Code. This implementation plan focuses on creating a simple proof of concept to demonstrate the core functionality.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Project Structure**
   - Directory structure for input, tasks, and results
   - Sample task list file

2. **Task Format**
   - Define task list format (Markdown)
   - Task parsing logic
   - Individual task file generation

3. **Task Execution**
   - Claude integration
   - Context isolation
   - Progress tracking and status display

4. **Documentation**
   - README updates
   - QUICKSTART guide enhancements
   - Task format guidelines

## Proof of Concept Components

### 1. Sample Task List

We've created a sample task list in `input/sample_tasks.md` with four different tasks:
- Analyze Python Code Structure
- Generate Documentation Template
- Create Unit Test Examples
- Develop CLI Argument Parser

### 2. CLI Commands

A set of CLI commands that demonstrate:
- Creating a project from the task list
- Running all tasks with Claude
- Displaying real-time progress with streaming output
- Showing task status

Example of running tasks with debugging:
```bash
python -m task_runner run input/sample_tasks.md --base-dir ./debug_project --debug-claude
```

### 3. Updated Documentation

- Enhanced QUICKSTART.md with detailed instructions
- Updated README.md with quick demo section
- Maintained existing TASK_FORMAT.md guidelines

## Testing the Proof of Concept

To test the Claude Task Runner proof of concept:

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/grahama1970/claude_task_runner.git
   cd claude_task_runner

   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install the package
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Test Using CLI Commands**
   ```bash
   # Create a project from the task list
   python -m task_runner create debug_project input/sample_tasks.md
   
   # Run the tasks with debugging enabled
   python -m task_runner run --base-dir ./debug_project --debug-claude
   
   # Check task status
   python -m task_runner status --base-dir ./debug_project
   ```

3. **Examine Results**
   - Check the `tasks` directory for individual task files
   - Review the `results` directory for Claude's responses
   - Examine the task status and summary

## Next Steps

After successful proof of concept testing:

1. Enhance task parsing with more sophisticated format recognition
2. Add support for task dependencies and sequencing
3. Implement more detailed progress reporting
4. Add support for task templates and reusable components
5. Create a web interface for task management
6. Implement collaborative features for team environments

## Conclusion

This proof of concept demonstrates the core functionality of the Claude Task Runner:
- Task breakdown and isolation
- Context-focused execution
- Progress monitoring
- Result organization

The implementation follows the project's architectural principles of separating core functionality, presentation, and MCP integration.
