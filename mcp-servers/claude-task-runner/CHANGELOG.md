# CHANGELOG - Claude Task Runner

All notable changes to the Claude Task Runner project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-16

### Added - API System Configuration Audit
- **[12:40 UTC] Critical API System Configuration Audit Report**
  - Comprehensive analysis of API documentation vs actual implementation
  - Investigation of Kong Gateway configuration and routing issues
  - Security and authentication system vulnerability assessment
  - Service mesh integration problem identification
  - API monitoring and health check system evaluation
  - Versioning and compatibility issue analysis
  - Rate limiting and security measure examination
  - Detailed fix recommendations with priority matrix

### Discovered - API System Critical Issues
- **70% of Documented Endpoints Missing**: Major discrepancy between docs and reality
- **No Authentication System**: JWT documented but not implemented
- **Kong Gateway Misconfiguration**: Routes to non-existent endpoints
- **Service Mesh Integration Incomplete**: Missing critical coordination
- **Database Schema Absent**: PostgreSQL empty with no migrations
- **Version Conflicts**: Documentation shows v17.0.0, backend reports v2.0.0
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: No rate limiting, CORS misconfigured, secrets exposed

### Immediate Actions Required
- **Priority 0 (24 hours)**: Implement authentication, fix CORS, remove broken routes
- **Priority 1 (48 hours)**: Align documentation, initialize database, fix models
- **Priority 2 (1 week)**: Complete service mesh, add monitoring, implement logging

### Files Created
- `/docs/API_SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION_AUDIT.md` - Comprehensive API audit findings

### Added - Frontend System Audit
- **[14:37 UTC] Comprehensive Frontend System Audit Report**
  - Complete analysis of service mesh frontend integration points
  - Investigation of task-decomposition-service frontend exposure (port 10030)
  - Assessment of workspace-isolation-service frontend interfaces (port 10031)
  - MCP server frontend coordination analysis (port 3000)
  - Streamlit service discovery and integration assessment (port 8501)
  - Backend API frontend coordination validation (port 8000)
  - Rule compliance verification across all 20 frontend architecture rules

### Analyzed
- **Service Mesh Frontend Integration Patterns**
  - K8s LoadBalancer and NodePort configurations for external access
  - Health check endpoints and monitoring integration points
  - Network policies and service discovery patterns
  - Configuration drift in Claude Flow service references

### Discovered
- **NO NATIVE FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE** - Task runner is backend-only by design
- **Configuration Gaps**: References to non-existent Claude Flow frontend service
- **External Streamlit Service**: Independent service running on port 8501 needs investigation
- **Rule Compliance Status**: 90% compliant with frontend architecture standards

### Compliance Issues Identified
- **Minor Rule 1 Violation**: Fantasy Claude Flow service references in configuration
- **Rule 18 Requirement**: Missing CHANGELOG.md (resolved with this file creation)
- **Service Integration Gap**: MCP coordination references need cleanup

### Recommendations Generated
1. **Configuration Cleanup**: Remove fantasy Claude Flow references from service configs
2. **Service Investigation**: Assess Streamlit service integration requirements
3. **Documentation**: Complete service boundary documentation
4. **Architecture Decision**: Maintain backend-only design or plan frontend implementation

### Files Created
- `/docs/FRONTEND_SYSTEM_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive audit findings
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - This change tracking file for Rule 18 compliance

## [1.0.0] - Previous Releases

### System Architecture
- Task Runner CLI implementation with MCP server integration
- K3s service mesh with task-decomposition and workspace-isolation services
- Backend API structure with health check endpoints
- Docker container orchestration with proper security contexts
- Monitoring and metrics collection through Prometheus integration

### Core Features
- Isolated task execution with Claude Code integration
- Git workspace management and environment isolation
- Task decomposition and delegation capabilities
- Real-time progress tracking and status display
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server functionality
