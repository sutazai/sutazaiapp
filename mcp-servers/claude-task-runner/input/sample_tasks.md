# Sample Project Tasks

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use Claude Task Runner.

## Task 1: Analyze Python Code Structure

Please analyze the following Python codebase structure. List the main components, their purpose, and how they interact with each other.

Key points to address:
- Core components and their responsibilities
- Project architecture
- Code organization
- API endpoints (if any)
- Main entry points

This will help us understand the overall architecture before diving into specific tasks.

## Task 2: Generate Documentation Template

Create a template for documenting Python functions that includes:
- Function description
- Parameters with types and descriptions
- Return values with types and descriptions
- Example usage
- Error handling

The template should follow Python docstring conventions and be compatible with tools like Sphinx.

## Task 3: Create Unit Test Examples

Create example unit tests for a Python function that:
1. Processes a list of dictionaries
2. Filters them based on specific criteria
3. Transforms the data
4. Returns a new structure

Include examples of:
- Test setup
- Mocking dependencies
- Testing edge cases
- Assertion strategies

## Task 4: Develop CLI Argument Parser

Create a Python script that implements a command-line interface with the following features:
- Multiple commands (at least 3)
- Command-specific arguments
- Global arguments that apply to all commands
- Help text for each command and argument
- Error handling for invalid inputs

Use argparse or click libraries and follow best practices for CLI design.
