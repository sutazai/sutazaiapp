# Analyze Python Code Structure

Please analyze the following Python codebase structure. List the main components, their purpose, and how they interact with each other.

Key points to address:
- Core components and their responsibilities
- Project architecture
- Code organization
- API endpoints (if any)
- Main entry points

This will help us understand the overall architecture before diving into specific tasks.
