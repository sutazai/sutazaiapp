## Manual Review Required

Any packages marked as `==LATEST_SECURE` need manual version specification.
Please update these with the latest security-patched versions.

## Next Steps

1. Test all services with pinned dependencies
2. Update CI/CD pipelines to use exact versions
3. Regularly update to newer secure versions
4. Monitor security advisories for updates
