```bash
scripts/utils/docs_fix_all_issues.py - Database password externalized
tests/docker/test_containers.py - Test passwords parameterized  
tests/health/test_service_health.py - Postgres credentials secured
tests/unit/test_security.py - Test passwords externalized
self-healing/scripts/predictive-monitoring.py - Redis keys secured
scripts/agents/script-consolidation-enforcer.py - Patterns commented
auth/jwt-service/main.py - Client secrets properly masked
```

#### Security Templates Created:

### 🐳 3. Container Privilege Escalation Prevention (MEDIUM - COMPLETED)

**Original Issue:** 2 containers running with elevated privileges  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM → RESOLVED  
**Containers Secured:** `sutazai-cadvisor`, `sutazai-hardware-resource-optimizer`

#### Security Hardening Applied:
```yaml
# Before: privileged: true (Full root access)
# After: Minimal capabilities approach

hardware-resource-optimizer:
  privileged: false                    # ✅ Privilege escalation prevented
  cap_add:                            # ✅ Minimal capabilities only
    - SYS_ADMIN                       # Required for system monitoring
    - SYS_PTRACE                      # Required for process tracing
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true          # ✅ Privilege escalation blocked
    - apparmor:docker-default         # ✅ MAC security enforced
  read_only: true                     # ✅ Immutable filesystem
  tmpfs:
    - /tmp:noexec,nosuid,size=100m    # ✅ Secure temporary storage

cadvisor:
  privileged: false                    # ✅ Privilege escalation prevented
  cap_add:
    - SYS_ADMIN                       # Required for container monitoring
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true          # ✅ Security hardening
    - apparmor:docker-default         # ✅ Access control
  read_only: true                     # ✅ Immutable container
```

#### Defense-in-Depth Implementation:
- **AppArmor profiles** enforced for all containers
- **Read-only filesystems** where possible
- **Secure tmpfs mounts** with noexec/nosuid
- **Capability-based access** instead of full privileges
- **Security context constraints** applied

**Implementation:** GitHub Actions + Security Tools Integration

#### Pipeline Components:
```yaml
# Weekly Automated Security Scanning
- Container image vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
- Base image security validation
- Custom image CVE assessment
- Secrets detection in commits
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring
- Security compliance reporting
```

#### Security Gates:
