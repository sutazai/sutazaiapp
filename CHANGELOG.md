  * Added authentication dependencies for protecting routes
  * Created OAuth2PasswordBearer scheme for token extraction
  * Implemented rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
  * Added account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
  * Generated secure SECRET_KEY: DWeRYZs3gvcgTvi_aEZqi8lhp0bLdvE-2fbcCQpR5CA
