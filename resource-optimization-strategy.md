# SutazAI System Resource Optimization Strategy

## Executive Summary

Based on system analysis of the SutazAI platform with 12 CPU cores, 29.38GB RAM, and 69 AI agents, current utilization shows significant optimization opportunities:

- **Current State**: 28% memory usage, 2% CPU usage
- **Running Containers**: 7 active containers (most agents inactive)
- **Health Monitor**: Fixed 929 containers with 10 restart attempts
- **Resource Waste**: Massive over-provisioning with 72% memory idle

## Critical Findings

### 1. Resource Allocation Issues
- **Ollama Service**: Allocated 10 CPUs + 20GB RAM but using minimal resources
- **Neo4j Database**: Consuming 1.13GB RAM but allocated 4GB limit
- **Agent Containers**: Most agents not running despite being defined in compose files
- **Over-provisioning**: GPU-capable containers (JAX, PyTorch, TensorFlow) allocated 20 CPUs each

### 2. Performance Bottlenecks
- **Container Startup Delays**: Health monitors show frequent restart attempts
- **Resource Fragmentation**: Large reservations preventing efficient scheduling
- **Network Overhead**: 69 services on single network without QoS prioritization
- **Storage I/O**: 87GB local volumes with minimal optimization

## Container Scheduling Policies

### 1. Priority-Based Scheduling
```yaml

    medium: 600        # Monitoring & tools
    low: 400           # Development tools
    background: 200    # Batch jobs
```

### 2. Resource Quotas and Limits
```yaml
resource_quotas:
  tier1_infrastructure:
    requests.cpu: "6"
    requests.memory: "14Gi"
    limits.cpu: "8" 
    limits.memory: "16Gi"
  
  tier2_agents:
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: "4Gi"
    limits.cpu: "4"
    limits.memory: "8Gi"
```

### 3. Anti-Affinity Rules
